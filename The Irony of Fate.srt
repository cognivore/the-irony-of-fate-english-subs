in Eldar RYAZANOV's film

00:03:21,395 --> 00:03:27,396
THE IRONY OF FATE
OR SAUNA BLUES

6
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:34,235
A totally untypical story,
that could have happened

7
00:03:34,475 --> 00:03:38,035
only and solely on New Year's eve.

Lyubov SOKOLOVA
Gotlib RONINSON

23
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:28,388
Moscow suburban villages:
Troparevo, Chertanovo,

24
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:32,988
Medvedkovo
and of course Cheremushki

25
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:36,467
didn't think,
that they will be immortalized

26
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:38,427
on the same gruesome day,

27
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:41,426
that they will be wiped off
the face of the Earth.

28
00:05:43,786 --> 00:05:47,946
The village Cheremushki gave
its name to a new neighborhood,

29
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:52,866
That grew in the South-Western
part of the capital.

30
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:57,505
Nearly every Soviet city nowadays

31
00:05:57,746 --> 00:05:59,745
has its own Cheremushki
neighborhood.

32
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:05,305
In bygone days when someone
found himself in a strange city,

33
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:08,545
he felt lost and lonely.

34
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,785
Everything around was strange:
houses, streets and life itself.

35
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:15,024
But it's all different now.

36
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:17,864
A person comes to a strange city,

37
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:20,704
but feels at home there.

38
00:06:22,944 --> 00:06:25,944
To think what lengths of absurdity
our ancestors went to,

39
00:06:26,184 --> 00:06:29,663
when they were sweating over
each architectural project!

40
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,224
Nowadays in every city you will find

41
00:06:32,463 --> 00:06:36,023
a standard movie theatre "Rocket",
where you can see

42
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:38,623
a standard film.

43
00:06:40,703 --> 00:06:43,942
- Do you sell oranges?
- Over there.

44
00:06:44,463 --> 00:06:49,783
Everyone come to the fair!
Christmas decorations, fireworks

45
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:55,062
and presents for everyone.
Here, my friends!

46
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:59,742
Names of the streets are
not too inventive either.

47
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:03,381
What city doesn't have
a 1st Sadovaya or a 2nd Zagorodnaya,

48
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:08,501
a 3rd Factory St., a Park St.,
an Industrial St.,

49
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:12,780
or a 3rd Constructors St.?
Sounds romantic, doesn't it?

50
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,300
Staircases that all look the same

51
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,940
are all painted with a standard
pleasant color.

52
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,820
Standard apartments furnished
with standard furniture,

53
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:26,060
standard locks cut into
blind featureless doors.

54
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,619
Zhenya, darling,
I have an unusual proposition.

55
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,179
Oh, is that so?

56
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:36,539
I'm scared already.

57
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:41,579
Zhenya, let's see
in the New Year together.

58
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:47,218
Well of course.
Isn't that how we planned it?

59
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,658
No.

60
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,058
You don't understand.
Let it be just you and me.

61
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,458
What do you mean "just you and me"?
I don't understand.

62
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,737
Let's not go to the Katanyans.

63
00:07:57,378 --> 00:08:02,017
But that's impossible, Galya.
We've already made arrangements.

64
00:08:02,777 --> 00:08:07,737
They are my friends.
And you've already made your crab salad.

65
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:10,097
You know I love crabs!

66
00:08:10,697 --> 00:08:13,096
That's great.
We'll eat them together.

67
00:08:13,696 --> 00:08:15,857
Where will we eat them?

68
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,097
You are so slow!

69
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:21,776
We will stay here, at your place.

70
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:24,376
Right here?

71
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:27,616
But what about the Katanyans?

72
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:30,335
Oleg invites me to celebrate

73
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:32,855
at the Ostankino TV
tower restaurant.

74
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,775
Give me the top.

75
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:37,415
- It rotates.
- Who?

76
00:08:37,655 --> 00:08:39,135
The restaurant.

77
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:45,814
Well if you want to rotate,
then please do.

78
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:49,654
I want to see in the
New Year with you.

79
00:08:51,454 --> 00:08:54,134
Really? Let's do it then!

80
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:59,213
- You are so stupid!
- And who else shall we invite?

81
00:08:59,454 --> 00:09:01,773
That's the point. No one.

82
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:07,173
What do you mean, no one?
And what about my mother?

83
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:10,813
Your mother will go someplace.
She'll cook everything,

84
00:09:11,053 --> 00:09:15,172
lay the table, I'll help her.
You got a terrific mom.

85
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:20,732
Wonderful idea! How come
I didn't think about it myself?

86
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:23,972
One of the two has to be more
clever than the other.

87
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,252
- It will be you.
- Zhenya, stop it!

88
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:30,052
And what about the Katanyans?
I don't understand...

89
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:34,812
Oleg invited me to see
in the New Year

90
00:09:35,051 --> 00:09:36,651
at a monastery in Suzdal.

91
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,771
To hell with Oleg!
To hell with the monastery!

92
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:44,531
I don't want to go anywhere.
I want to be with you.

93
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,290
With me?

94
00:09:59,809 --> 00:10:03,329
Excuse me, I'm looking
for the 3rd Constructors St.

95
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,809
It's over there,
behind those tall buildings.

96
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:09,849
- You'll see a church there.
- Thank you.

97
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:18,968
We will see in the New Year together.
Just you and me.

98
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:21,448
I'll have one too many...

99
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:27,568
and become brave and bold...

100
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:31,608
And I'll finally tell you
everything I have to tell you.

101
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,168
Znenya!

102
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:38,968
I don't believe it!
Are you going to propose?

103
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:42,287
After two years of being together...

104
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:51,806
Let's wait until New Year's eve,
when the bells chime...

105
00:10:52,046 --> 00:10:54,046
Let's wait...

106
00:10:55,966 --> 00:11:00,326
It's just that I'm afraid
you will never summon your courage.

107
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:06,605
It is the cowardice...
of an old bachelor.

108
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,725
You know,
I already proposed to a woman once.

109
00:11:11,965 --> 00:11:15,685
To my utter amazement
she said "yes".

110
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:18,445
But when I imagined,

111
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:21,164
that she will come
to live at my place,

112
00:11:23,204 --> 00:11:25,164
and every day...

113
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:29,204
she will flash before my eyes...

114
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:32,764
hither and thither,
hither and thither...

115
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:36,323
I broke down and ran
away to Leningrad.

116
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,803
Will you run away from me too?

117
00:11:42,683 --> 00:11:45,643
It's impossible to run away from you.

118
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:51,362
My decision is final an irreversible.

119
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:56,562
I held on for a long
time and finally broke.

120
00:11:59,082 --> 00:12:00,322
Zhenya...

121
00:12:02,962 --> 00:12:07,361
What do you think,
when do people sing?

122
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:10,041
Sing?

123
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,521
When? At street rallies.

124
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,720
- Well... Any other time?
- They sing in the opera.

125
00:12:17,441 --> 00:12:19,281
They sing when they
have one too many.

126
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,841
Stupid! You know when people sing?

127
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,440
- When they don't have
a musical ear? - No.

128
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:29,440
- When they're happy.
- That's right.

129
00:12:44,359 --> 00:12:47,439
There will be no one in the house,

130
00:12:48,438 --> 00:12:50,399
Just the twilight,

131
00:12:51,078 --> 00:12:53,519
Just one winter day

132
00:12:53,758 --> 00:12:59,398
In the opening of the curtains,
Someone forgot to shut,

133
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,838
Curtains, someone forgot to shut.

134
00:13:07,678 --> 00:13:11,037
Just damp white snow lumps

135
00:13:12,037 --> 00:13:15,357
Swiftly flying by.

136
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:20,436
There's just the roofs and
the snow, and...

137
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:23,236
Just the roofs and the snow,
And no one else,

138
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:26,557
There's no one else.

139
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:32,236
And once again the hoarfrost
Will draw its tracery,

140
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:35,796
And like before I will be
caught in the whirlwind

141
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:41,675
Of last year's despondency,
and the memories of another witer,

142
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,515
And the memories of another Winter.

143
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:53,075
But suddenly the curtain shudder
with someone's intrusion.

144
00:13:53,394 --> 00:13:57,114
Measuring the silence with
your soft steps,

145
00:13:57,355 --> 00:14:03,234
Measuring the silence,
you will appear like the future itself.

146
00:14:04,674 --> 00:14:07,433
You will be standing in the doorway,

147
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:12,193
Dressed in something
white and simple,

148
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:16,392
Like one of those fabrics,

149
00:14:16,953 --> 00:14:19,512
Out of which they make snow flakes,

150
00:14:20,353 --> 00:14:22,912
Out of which they make snow flakes.

151
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:26,673
There will be no one in the house,

152
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,192
Just the twilight.

153
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:35,551
Just one winter day in the opening

154
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,871
Of the curtains,
someone forgot to shut,

155
00:14:39,192 --> 00:14:41,831
Curtains, someone forgot to shut.

156
00:15:17,669 --> 00:15:19,549
- Maria Dmitrievna...
- Quiet!

157
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:21,708
Happy New Year!

158
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:23,229
Not so loud, will you!

159
00:15:23,668 --> 00:15:24,668
Why?

160
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:29,428
- Who is it, mother?
- It's just a neighbor, dear.

161
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:33,468
- What's going on?
- Pavel, come back tomorrow.

162
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:36,147
I'm leaving for Leningrad tonight.

163
00:15:36,948 --> 00:15:38,387
Well, bon voyage.

164
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:54,626
What do you think you're doing?

165
00:15:54,866 --> 00:16:00,266
- Mother, who is it again?
- A telegram from aunt Vera.

166
00:16:00,746 --> 00:16:03,666
Remember how you taught us boys
to always tell

167
00:16:03,906 --> 00:16:04,986
the truth?

168
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:08,666
There are situations
when it's better to tell a lye.

169
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:11,786
But Misha and Sasha
are waiting for us at the bathhouse.

170
00:16:12,025 --> 00:16:13,025
That's no problem.

171
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,345
I'm leaving to Leningrad right after.

172
00:16:15,585 --> 00:16:19,065
Why do you have to go to
Leningrad?

173
00:16:19,305 --> 00:16:21,945
Irina is there on business,
and I'm flying over

174
00:16:22,185 --> 00:16:25,224
to see in the New Year with her.
What's going on anyway?

175
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:30,104
- It's a secret.
- What secret?

176
00:16:30,344 --> 00:16:35,264
- You'll find out in due time.
- Zhenya has no secrets from me.

177
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:37,303
Go on, split!

178
00:16:49,423 --> 00:16:54,503
Zhenya, I have to go.
I have so much to do!

179
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:02,822
- Galya!..
- What?

180
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:08,342
Galya...

181
00:17:11,182 --> 00:17:12,981
The thing is...

182
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:18,181
How do they say that?..

183
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,260
I love you.

184
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,900
I want you to marry me.

185
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,340
But I will always be flashing before
your eyes.

186
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,859
Please do.

187
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:40,500
I want you to.

188
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:50,579
Here's the key.
Come at 11 to see in the New Year.

189
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:00,978
Shall I bring the salad?

190
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,217
The salad?

191
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,418
I didn't understand the main thing:
do you say "yes"?

192
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:10,657
I took the key, didn't I?

193
00:18:12,537 --> 00:18:14,377
And what does that mean?

194
00:18:16,937 --> 00:18:18,937
That doesn't mean anything.

195
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:27,096
See you tonight.
Say good-bye to your mother from me.

196
00:18:31,696 --> 00:18:35,136
- I'm worried about the Katanyans.
- Forget it.

197
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:06,054
Mother!

198
00:19:08,174 --> 00:19:12,093
Amidst a bustling ball,

199
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,574
Suddenly...

200
00:19:17,813 --> 00:19:21,253
In the troubles
of the mundane bustle...

201
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:28,012
- I think I'm getting married.
- I think so too.

202
00:19:28,452 --> 00:19:30,772
What do you think of Galya?

203
00:19:31,012 --> 00:19:33,252
You're the one
who's getting married, not me.

204
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,652
But you are my mother!

205
00:19:37,571 --> 00:19:42,652
I hope you won't forget it
after you get married.

206
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:48,331
I take it that you don't like her.

207
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:51,570
Well, I'm not particularly
mad about her,

208
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,410
But she's rather intelligent
and has good manners.

209
00:19:56,651 --> 00:19:57,650
I see.

210
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:01,810
If you don't get married now,
you'll never get married.

211
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,050
I'm already 36...

212
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,529
It's not very polite
to remind me of my age.

213
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,809
Even though I take no offense.

214
00:20:12,849 --> 00:20:13,849
Get up!

215
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,169
Stop it! I'm not offended.
I'm a terrific mom, remember?

216
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:21,569
I'll cook everything
and go visit a friend.

217
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:26,928
- Where are the goblets?
- I'll find them. Goblets!

218
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:28,848
They should be here.

219
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,568
Moving from one place to another,
you can't find a thing.

220
00:20:31,808 --> 00:20:33,368
They're not here.

221
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:36,488
There they are!

222
00:20:38,808 --> 00:20:41,807
I wonder what she saw in me?

223
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,568
She's much younger than I am.

224
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:47,887
And then, she's so beautiful!

225
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:52,807
I'm also surprised,
she chose such a dimwit.

226
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:54,086
Dimwit?

227
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:58,646
Did you have to tell her
about Leningrad?

228
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:02,566
When a man proposes to one woman,

229
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:05,006
he doesn't talk about another.

230
00:21:05,606 --> 00:21:08,606
- Oh really? I didn't know.
- Yes.

231
00:21:08,846 --> 00:21:10,845
Now I know everything!

232
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,925
Now I know how a man should propose.

233
00:21:15,165 --> 00:21:16,405
You windbag!

234
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:20,525
- Who rang the doorbell all the time?
- Pavel.

235
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:24,564
He's leaving for Leningrad.
I told him to go away.

236
00:21:24,925 --> 00:21:28,604
Maybe I could go
to the bathhouse anyway?

237
00:21:28,925 --> 00:21:30,924
It won't do you any harm,

238
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:33,924
If you will see
in the New Year clean.

239
00:21:34,164 --> 00:21:35,684
It's decided. I'll go take a bath.

240
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:41,604
A bath in every apartment -
that's the way it should be.

241
00:21:42,563 --> 00:21:44,404
This is civilization.

242
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:46,923
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

243
00:21:47,403 --> 00:21:49,163
But the process of washing yourself,

244
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:53,363
that in a bathhouse acquires
the meaning of a ceremonial ritual,

245
00:21:55,082 --> 00:21:58,082
In your bath at home
is just scraping off the dirt.

246
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:02,962
And then this Russian tradition
of wishing "A light steam".

247
00:22:07,161 --> 00:22:08,362
Here's a refill.

248
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,602
Did you ever see steam
in your bathroom at home?

249
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,481
Misha is right, a good bath
makes you clean, body and soul.

250
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,401
Guys!

251
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:22,760
It's great here, but I have to go.

252
00:22:23,161 --> 00:22:25,841
No, you won't get away with that.

253
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:27,721
We're all waiting.

254
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,961
What are you waiting for?

255
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,800
Aren't we gonna drink to your
engagement?

256
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,680
Here, in the bathhouse?

257
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,639
Zhenya is right.
They don't serve alcohol in a bathhouse.

258
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,920
If not for me,
the situation would be hopeless.

259
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,399
There you go!

260
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,799
No, no, I can't.

261
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,038
Just one shot.
I have to go to the airport.

262
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:01,558
No sweat, guys!

263
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,518
Everyone has to be in shape.

264
00:23:06,237 --> 00:23:10,077
Why don't we do it tomorrow!
At my place.

265
00:23:10,318 --> 00:23:13,477
I'll introduce you to my wife.

266
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:16,037
Tomorrow I will be in Leningrad.

267
00:23:16,277 --> 00:23:17,718
Go ahead, drink.

268
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:22,077
I wonder what you chose.

269
00:23:22,316 --> 00:23:25,317
Not "what", but "who"!

270
00:23:26,717 --> 00:23:29,716
That's terrible: Vodka after beer.

271
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:32,036
I'm just off a night shift...

272
00:23:33,476 --> 00:23:36,636
There, here's a chocolate bar.
Something to chase it down with.

273
00:23:36,876 --> 00:23:39,396
All right, just one shot.

274
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,996
Pavel, your toast.

275
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:45,595
You are the most eloquent of us.

276
00:23:46,235 --> 00:23:49,915
- And you - the least intelligent.
- Thank you.

277
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:51,435
Here's a oast...

278
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:55,354
To Zhenya Lukashin.

279
00:23:55,595 --> 00:23:56,915
No, seriously.

280
00:23:57,155 --> 00:23:59,154
The most bashful one of us,

281
00:23:59,395 --> 00:24:03,594
who finally overcame his shyness
and decided to get married.

282
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,474
The last one of us.

283
00:24:06,994 --> 00:24:10,673
Zhenya, now the serious part.
Be happy!

284
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,914
- Be happy, Zhenya.
- This calls for a drink.

285
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:16,913
This is serious.

286
00:24:23,632 --> 00:24:27,312
Listen, what's her name?

287
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:36,872
She has a beautiful name.

288
00:24:39,152 --> 00:24:40,392
Galya.

289
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:43,511
And what's more, an uncommon one.

290
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:47,751
Guys, we have no choice.

291
00:24:49,231 --> 00:24:50,511
Here's to Galya!

292
00:24:52,231 --> 00:24:53,871
To Galya bottoms up!

293
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,631
Galya, be happy!

294
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,431
You bastards!

295
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:04,750
I had a night shift...

296
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:07,389
Not cold enough!

297
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,910
Tell us how you met.

298
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,589
It's a long story.

299
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,909
She came to my outpatients clinic.

300
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,069
Is she sick?

301
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:20,549
No.

302
00:25:22,469 --> 00:25:24,189
She had a dislocation.

303
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:27,949
A kink! Well that explains
why she is marrying you.

304
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:31,788
Let's drink to them both
being healthy.

305
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:35,548
Where do you get those bottles from?
Put it away!

306
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:37,788
My wife asked me
to buy some for tonight.

307
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:41,508
If we go on at such pace,

308
00:25:41,747 --> 00:25:43,748
I have good chances
of missing my plane.

309
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:48,627
Pavel, trust me. I never get drunk.

310
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:50,347
Give me your ticket.

311
00:25:50,587 --> 00:25:53,427
It's definitely bad for my health!

312
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,386
She'll think I'm an alcoholic!

313
00:26:00,587 --> 00:26:03,827
That's unheard of!
A doctor refuses to drink to good health.

314
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:09,226
Why did I have to come here!

315
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:16,786
Now tell us how you met her.

316
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:21,105
Are you asking me? Who with?

317
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:24,505
Galya. Or is there someone else?

318
00:26:24,745 --> 00:26:27,345
No, there's no one. I'm single.

319
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:32,064
- What to?
- Let's drink to bachelors.

320
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:34,304
To unmarried life! Hip-hip-hurrah!

321
00:26:34,904 --> 00:26:36,904
You can't miss this one!

322
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:38,623
It's all the same to you!

323
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:43,223
But I can't imagine
what's going to happen to me,

324
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:46,623
if I maybe come home in time
to see in the New Year.

325
00:26:47,383 --> 00:26:52,423
People, I have a very
important toast.

326
00:26:52,983 --> 00:26:55,503
You've had enough.
You're getting married, remember?

327
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:57,703
I haven't forgotten.

328
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:00,622
If you do, I will remind you.

329
00:27:01,143 --> 00:27:04,862
Guys, let's drink to our friendship.

330
00:27:05,143 --> 00:27:06,902
That's a good boy!

331
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:10,822
Good speech!
You're a natural born orator.

332
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:12,541
Give me some space.

333
00:27:12,902 --> 00:27:16,981
Let's weigh ourselves "Brudershaft".

334
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,141
What will the two of us
weigh together?

335
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:30,260
Guys, I have a lyrical
romantic toast.

336
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,660
That's enough!
We have to go to the airport.

337
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:38,500
- What for?
- One of us is going to Leningrad.

338
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:44,539
- Let's go!
- Let's fly!

339
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,419
Fasten your bed-sheets!
Prepare for takeoff!

340
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:55,059
Down below, under the wing sings

341
00:27:56,179 --> 00:27:59,179
the green see of the Taiga.

342
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:06,459
Down below, under the wing sings

343
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:13,818
the green see of the Taiga.

344
00:28:16,618 --> 00:28:21,017
Attention all passengers,
boarding TU-134,

345
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:26,017
flight 392,
en route from Moscow to Leningrad.

346
00:28:26,897 --> 00:28:30,096
All passengers please proceed
to the departure gate.

347
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:37,576
- I think that's our flight.
- I think you're right.

348
00:28:38,896 --> 00:28:41,736
Do you remember,
which one of us is flying?

349
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:42,976
No.

350
00:28:44,896 --> 00:28:47,696
Wait, trust me.

351
00:28:49,215 --> 00:28:53,375
- Let's appeal to common logic.
- Let's.

352
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:58,374
- Are you flying to Leningrad?
- No.

353
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:00,255
Me neither.

354
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:05,855
Flight No 392 to Leningrad
boarding now.

355
00:29:07,374 --> 00:29:09,814
Can Pavel be flying to Leningrad?

356
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:12,894
He can.

357
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,453
What about Zhenya?

358
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:20,333
He can too.

359
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,413
They both can.

360
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:29,573
Shall we cast lots?

361
00:29:33,612 --> 00:29:36,252
Let's not give ourselves
into the hands of chance.

362
00:29:39,452 --> 00:29:41,332
When in the bathhouse,
what did we drink to?

363
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:44,532
Lukashin's health.

364
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:47,731
Because he's getting married.

365
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:52,811
- You've got an amazing memory.
- Later.

366
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:58,451
That means,
Zhenya is flying to Leningrad,

367
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:02,011
to attend his own wedding.

368
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,730
And he would say so himself,
if he wasn't that tired.

369
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:09,370
Wait!

370
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,530
He said he met his fiancee
at his outpatient clinic,

371
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:17,010
when she came to see a doctor.

372
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:18,729
I will answer you.

373
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,689
What does that mean?

374
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:27,088
Than means, she was in Moscow on
a business trip.

375
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:31,609
Iron logic.

376
00:30:32,209 --> 00:30:35,208
Boarding Aeroflot flight 392

377
00:30:35,449 --> 00:30:39,449
en route from Moscow to Leningrad
completed.

378
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:42,368
Careful!

379
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:46,727
- Where are you taking me?
- To meet your happiness.

380
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:51,727
Wait! It's a good thing
we washed him.

381
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:42,884
Attention! Flight

382
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:45,924
392 from Moscow has just landed.

383
00:31:46,164 --> 00:31:50,563
- Careful!
- What did I do to deserve this?

384
00:31:50,803 --> 00:31:55,283
Flight from Moscow has just landed.

385
00:31:56,603 --> 00:31:57,843
I'm cold!

386
00:32:09,522 --> 00:32:10,762
Damn!

387
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:16,362
You shouldn't drink so much.

388
00:32:18,681 --> 00:32:19,922
Pavel!

389
00:32:20,441 --> 00:32:25,122
Attention all passengers
flying to Krasnoyarsk.

390
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:28,361
Your flight is delayed until 12 p.m.

391
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:32,161
due to bad weather in Krasnoyarsk.

392
00:32:38,521 --> 00:32:40,360
What time is it?

393
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,120
2 hours 50 minutes to go until the
New Year.

394
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,360
Watch yourself, young man!

395
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:53,759
- Where am I?
- Same place I am.

396
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:58,439
- And where are you?
- At the airport.

397
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,598
It's bad weather in Krasnoyarsk.

398
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:09,398
At worst I'll see in the New Year
in this armchair...

399
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:13,598
And at best?

400
00:33:14,478 --> 00:33:17,357
Also in an armchair, only in the air.

401
00:33:17,878 --> 00:33:20,277
Have you ever seen in
the New Year in the air?

402
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:22,957
No. And I don't want to.

403
00:33:23,198 --> 00:33:25,117
Me either. But what can I do?

404
00:33:25,357 --> 00:33:28,757
- Who are you?
- I'm a human being.

405
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:36,796
We saw Pavel to the airport,
and now I'm going home.

406
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:39,356
Very well, all the best.

407
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,596
- Happy New Year.
- Same to you.

408
00:33:45,116 --> 00:33:47,715
Drop the familiarities.

409
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,676
Don't you think it's too early,
young man?

410
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:57,595
You free?

411
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,835
- Yes. Where to?
- 3rd Constructors St.,

412
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:04,115
25, apartment 12, 4th floor.

413
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:06,235
I don't care if it's the 5th!

414
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,312
Taxi!

415
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:48,111
Let me out of here!

416
00:34:52,431 --> 00:34:55,431
People! Happy New Year!

417
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,910
Home at last!

418
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,830
I'm home.

419
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,510
"There will be no one in he
house..."

420
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:18,629
And who are these people here?
You're not afraid of me?

421
00:35:18,949 --> 00:35:20,630
Careful!

422
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,870
I fell through. Thank you.

423
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,709
Go ahead... Only after you...

424
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:30,069
You won't bite me, will you?

425
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:35,268
Going up.

426
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:39,388
Come visit me. It's apartment 12.

427
00:35:39,669 --> 00:35:44,987
"Jim, give me your paw for
happiness". - Come on.

428
00:35:45,508 --> 00:35:46,748
He doesn't want to!

429
00:35:47,347 --> 00:35:49,508
Happy New Year to you!

430
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:55,187
Dogs walking around!

431
00:36:07,106 --> 00:36:08,547
Mother!

432
00:37:16,342 --> 00:37:18,222
Careful, careful...

433
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,899
Hold the elevator, please!

434
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,370
Hey!..

435
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:40,169
Wake up! Do you hear me?

436
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:44,128
Wake up this very minute! Get up!

437
00:40:45,328 --> 00:40:46,448
Are you dead or alive?

438
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:51,248
All right!..

439
00:40:53,008 --> 00:40:55,847
Wake up now! Do you hear me?

440
00:40:56,088 --> 00:40:58,168
Get up! What are you doing here?

441
00:41:02,247 --> 00:41:04,647
Don't jolt me!

442
00:41:06,326 --> 00:41:09,167
I want to get some sleep.

443
00:41:11,326 --> 00:41:13,647
Who are you? How did you get here?

444
00:41:13,886 --> 00:41:17,566
Stop jolting me! Get up!

445
00:41:19,086 --> 00:41:22,446
- You're hurting me!
- Get up this very minute!

446
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:25,566
Stop disturbing me!

447
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:27,005
Unbelievable!

448
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:29,685
All right, you asked for it!

449
00:41:56,923 --> 00:41:59,723
I warn you for the last time.

450
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:08,403
Oh, that feels good!
Can I have some more?

451
00:42:11,002 --> 00:42:12,723
I'm sailing away!

452
00:42:16,162 --> 00:42:17,722
What is this?

453
00:42:22,762 --> 00:42:27,042
What are you doing? It's wet!
Are you crazy?

454
00:42:27,721 --> 00:42:30,241
Have you all gone mad?

455
00:42:30,641 --> 00:42:34,201
I'm not a flower-bed.

456
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:41,960
Who are you?

457
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,640
What's going on here?

458
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,000
Get out of here now!

459
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,880
This is unheard of!

460
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,759
- What are you doing here?
- I was sleeping.

461
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,000
What? What do you want?

462
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,679
Stop playing the fool!

463
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,279
- Why?
- What are you doing lying here?

464
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:05,879
Get out this instant!

465
00:43:06,118 --> 00:43:07,359
Now!

466
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,559
What a boor! It's not enough
that you broke into my flat,

467
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,798
but you behave like a gangster!

468
00:43:16,838 --> 00:43:17,998
What is this?

469
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:21,757
- Your flat?
- That's right, I live here.

470
00:43:21,998 --> 00:43:24,997
- Then where do you suppose I live?
- I don't know.

471
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:28,358
And I don't care. That's outrageous!

472
00:43:28,597 --> 00:43:32,557
For your information my fiancee
will be coming any minute now.

473
00:43:32,797 --> 00:43:33,797
I don't want her

474
00:43:34,037 --> 00:43:36,397
to see you here.

475
00:43:37,917 --> 00:43:40,997
How come your fiancee
will be coming to my place?

476
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:47,836
It's a bad time for jokes!
My head's splitting!

477
00:43:49,556 --> 00:43:50,996
What time is it?

478
00:43:54,635 --> 00:43:56,875
My god, it's nearly 11 p.m.!
I'm expecting guests.

479
00:43:57,115 --> 00:44:01,475
And you presence
here is not at all welcome.

480
00:44:01,915 --> 00:44:06,035
How come your friends
will be coming to my place?

481
00:44:06,275 --> 00:44:07,995
I'm thirsty!

482
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:14,315
Are you crazy? W
hy do you behave so outrageously?

483
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:15,795
Listen to me!

484
00:44:16,034 --> 00:44:19,234
Get a hold of yourself.
Where do you think you are?

485
00:44:19,714 --> 00:44:23,554
At home. 25, 3rd Constructors St...

486
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:24,993
Oh no!

487
00:44:25,234 --> 00:44:27,393
I live at 25, 3rd Constructor St.,

488
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:28,634
Apartment 12.

489
00:44:28,873 --> 00:44:29,913
Oh no, darling.

490
00:44:30,153 --> 00:44:31,473
Shoo!

491
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:34,553
Stop being a nuisance!

492
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:38,753
I live here with my mother.
32 meters of space.

493
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:43,193
No, me and my mother occupy
these 32 meters of space.

494
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:47,152
Congratulations!
Can't say we have very big apartments.

495
00:44:47,392 --> 00:44:49,392
Very sharp observation.

496
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:51,032
Who wrapped me
in this thing anyway?

497
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,992
I will be much obliged,

498
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:57,151
if you would evaporate
this very minute.

499
00:44:57,392 --> 00:45:02,271
Don't jolt me around!
I want some respect!

500
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:03,872
Mother!

501
00:45:04,351 --> 00:45:05,351
Mother left.

502
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:06,791
I'll kill you!

503
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:12,831
- Whose mother left?
- Thank god, we have different mothers.

504
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,151
Really?

505
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:27,909
Pardon me... And both mothers left?

506
00:45:29,389 --> 00:45:32,429
I have a feeling, one of us is nuts.

507
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:36,229
I know which one it is.

508
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,149
Yes, me too.

509
00:45:38,828 --> 00:45:40,908
Are you hinting at me?

510
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:46,988
Madhouse!

511
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,748
Why did you move my cupboard?

512
00:45:53,908 --> 00:45:56,227
It stands exactly where they put it.

513
00:45:57,068 --> 00:46:02,707
It is my Polish furniture set.

514
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:07,187
- 830 Rubles.
- And 20 extra.

515
00:46:08,306 --> 00:46:11,266
I paid 25.

516
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,746
That's your business.

517
00:46:14,307 --> 00:46:17,707
My god! I must be hallucinating!

518
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:26,826
And above all you stole our family
screen!

519
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:37,465
Why did mother put someone else's
plates on the table?

520
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,304
At last you are beginning
to see things clearly!

521
00:46:41,545 --> 00:46:43,704
What is there to see?

522
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:47,104
You broke in,
rearranged the furniture...

523
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:50,184
Changed the plates.

524
00:46:50,464 --> 00:46:52,664
What did you with my chandelier?

525
00:46:52,904 --> 00:46:54,904
Took it to a pawn shop.

526
00:46:55,824 --> 00:46:57,024
What for?

527
00:47:01,904 --> 00:47:03,623
Where am I?

528
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:08,422
25, 3rd Constructors St. Apartment 12.

529
00:47:08,663 --> 00:47:11,822
That's right, that's my address.
I swear it is!

530
00:47:12,902 --> 00:47:17,902
But somehow I have a feeling,
that I'm not at home.

531
00:47:18,143 --> 00:47:19,582
It's settled then!

532
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:21,622
You can leave now.

533
00:47:21,862 --> 00:47:24,302
I can't go anywhere
looking like that.

534
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:27,141
- My dress!
- Don't strip me!

535
00:47:27,382 --> 00:47:30,581
- Give me back my coat!
- You tread on my foot!

536
00:47:30,822 --> 00:47:34,981
That's outrageous!
It's my flat and I'm registered here!

537
00:47:35,221 --> 00:47:39,221
- Your flat?
- Yes, and my mother's!

538
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:42,381
- I'll show you my passport.
- You sot!

539
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,981
Boor! Where's my jacket?

540
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,700
- How do I know?
- Who knows then?

541
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,980
It's grey with a striped pattern...

542
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:53,420
I bought it at Mostorg.

543
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:55,660
Here it is, there's my little jacket.

544
00:47:55,899 --> 00:48:01,900
I'll show you where I live.
Breaking into people's...

545
00:48:02,139 --> 00:48:03,540
There you go...

546
00:48:03,779 --> 00:48:09,259
Apt. 12, 25, 3rd Constructors St.,
Moscow.

547
00:48:09,499 --> 00:48:13,178
There you go. An official document.

548
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:16,939
Now would you please leave.

549
00:48:17,178 --> 00:48:20,698
All right, I've had enough.

550
00:48:20,938 --> 00:48:23,098
- What is it?
- Moscow!

551
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:25,298
That's right, Moscow.

552
00:48:25,538 --> 00:48:27,378
- Is that so?
- What do you mean?

553
00:48:27,617 --> 00:48:29,738
You think you're in Moscow?

554
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:34,497
And where do you think I am?

555
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:36,857
Now I see...

556
00:48:37,097 --> 00:48:40,577
Any objections? In Moscow, darling,
in the capital.

557
00:48:40,856 --> 00:48:42,217
Wait...

558
00:48:44,217 --> 00:48:47,056
What do you want there?

559
00:48:47,376 --> 00:48:50,376
Stop rummaging about
through my things!

560
00:48:50,736 --> 00:48:53,536
- There.
- What did you take this out for?

561
00:48:53,816 --> 00:48:56,296
What is this?

562
00:48:57,815 --> 00:49:03,816
Apt. 12, 25, 3rd Constructors St.,
Leningrad.

563
00:49:06,975 --> 00:49:08,455
What?

564
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:16,534
Are you hinting,
that I am in Leningrad?

565
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,534
- Exactly.
- What do you mean "exactly"?

566
00:49:20,054 --> 00:49:21,055
In Leningrad.

567
00:49:21,814 --> 00:49:23,334
How did I get here?

568
00:49:24,134 --> 00:49:25,374
You poor thing.

569
00:49:26,334 --> 00:49:29,854
- We went to a bathhouse.
- Glad for you.

570
00:49:30,813 --> 00:49:34,774
- And now leave.
- I have nowhere to go.

571
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,893
Don't swing your arms about!

572
00:49:39,173 --> 00:49:44,532
Do you mean to say
I am in Leningrad right now?

573
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:47,332
I am here?

574
00:49:47,573 --> 00:49:49,412
In the city on the Neva river?

575
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:55,372
I remember everything clearly.

576
00:49:56,292 --> 00:50:02,051
We went to the airport
to see Pavel off.

577
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:05,291
Before that we went to take a bath.

578
00:50:08,531 --> 00:50:14,091
That means,
I flew away instead of Pavel?

579
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,690
- You have to stop drinking.
- I don't drink at all.

580
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:21,331
It was an accident.

581
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:28,169
So I'm in Leningrad!

582
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:38,169
That's terrible!

583
00:50:39,529 --> 00:50:43,089
My Galya is in Moscow,

584
00:50:43,328 --> 00:50:47,089
and here I am,
sitting on the floor in Leningrad.

585
00:50:54,608 --> 00:51:00,048
God, I wish at least
it was some other city.

586
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:11,602
Don't... What's going on there?

587
00:52:12,123 --> 00:52:13,923
Please don't open it!

588
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:18,562
If you don't open right away,
you'll make it worse.

589
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,203
For your information, it's him!

590
00:52:22,442 --> 00:52:26,962
Who's he? Don't open it!
I have to put my pants on.

591
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:31,241
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

592
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:36,322
Happy New Year, Nadya.

593
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,680
Give me your coat.

594
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,760
- How was your trip?
- Don't even ask!

595
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,720
The roads are slippery with ice.

596
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,839
You ought to be careful.
You are such a daredevil.

597
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:05,439
Thank you, Nadya.

598
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,319
If you only knew how I missed you,
darling.

599
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:14,238
I couldn't wait to see you myself.

600
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:16,439
Thank you, dearest.

601
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:21,879
I prepared a New Year
present for you.

602
00:53:22,118 --> 00:53:25,598
Thank you.
I have a present for you too.

603
00:53:29,118 --> 00:53:31,038
Only it's in the room.

604
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:37,277
Ippolit, I have to tell you
something.

605
00:53:38,517 --> 00:53:41,317
You won't believe it.

606
00:53:42,437 --> 00:53:44,357
You'll die of laughter!

607
00:53:45,117 --> 00:53:49,356
I come home, and on my sofa...

608
00:53:49,636 --> 00:53:52,397
I find a stranger.

609
00:53:52,876 --> 00:53:55,596
I couldn't wake him up.

610
00:53:57,716 --> 00:53:59,716
I pored water over him from a teapot.

611
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:09,875
- So I see...
- Please, I beg you!

612
00:54:10,115 --> 00:54:12,995
- Happy New Year.
- Behave yourself.

613
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:14,635
Please!

614
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,354
A nice present. Thank you.

615
00:54:17,595 --> 00:54:21,154
Just let me explain.
She has nothing to do with it.

616
00:54:21,435 --> 00:54:22,794
It's all my fault.

617
00:54:23,035 --> 00:54:26,634
I would like to know something.

618
00:54:26,874 --> 00:54:27,914
Yes, please.

619
00:54:28,154 --> 00:54:30,074
- Who is he?
- I don't know him.

620
00:54:30,514 --> 00:54:32,274
He's a perfect stranger.

621
00:54:32,513 --> 00:54:33,593
A stranger...

622
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:35,473
How did he get here?

623
00:54:35,714 --> 00:54:37,794
By an incredible coincidence.

624
00:54:38,033 --> 00:54:39,793
He also lives at

625
00:54:40,033 --> 00:54:45,393
25, Constructors St. Apartment 12.
Only in Moscow.

626
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:46,672
In Moscow!

627
00:54:46,913 --> 00:54:50,433
- What is that?
- Those are my pants.

628
00:54:50,672 --> 00:54:52,792
Careful, you'll rumple them.

629
00:54:53,472 --> 00:54:57,672
He went to a bathhouse
with his friends, had a drink...

630
00:54:58,272 --> 00:55:00,392
- Look at him.
- I will, in due time.

631
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:03,072
And they put him on board
an airplane, by mistake.

632
00:55:03,311 --> 00:55:04,951
Where? In the bathhouse?

633
00:55:05,231 --> 00:55:08,231
No, there are no airplanes
in a bathhouse.

634
00:55:08,951 --> 00:55:11,552
I'm not talking to you!

635
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:14,911
Tell him,
we were taking a bath with Pavel.

636
00:55:15,151 --> 00:55:17,111
Will you shut up!

637
00:55:17,831 --> 00:55:20,470
From the bathhouse they went
straight to the airport.

638
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:21,831
To see Pavel off.

639
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:25,551
- To see Pavel off.
- So Pavel is here too?!

640
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:29,870
No, there's no Pavel.
I'm here instead of him.

641
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,510
So you expected Pavel, but instead

642
00:55:31,749 --> 00:55:33,590
came this character?

643
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:37,790
She expected no one!

644
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:43,069
I expected no one.

645
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:47,869
- It was a mistake.
- They registered him as luggage?

646
00:55:48,109 --> 00:55:52,108
What luggage?
Or maybe I don't remember.

647
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:56,868
I will explain everything.
Only first I have to get dressed.

648
00:55:57,108 --> 00:55:58,508
Will you hold this for me.

649
00:55:58,748 --> 00:56:02,548
I will get dressed
and explain everything.

650
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:06,587
- He is so ugly!
- Absolutely disgusting!

651
00:56:06,827 --> 00:56:11,987
That is a matter of taste.
I haven't done anything to you.

652
00:56:12,267 --> 00:56:15,787
- How did he get into your bed?
- By accident.

653
00:56:16,027 --> 00:56:17,867
I beg your pardon, lady.

654
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:19,747
What is your name?

655
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:25,466
He was in your bed,
but he doesn't know your name!

656
00:56:26,346 --> 00:56:27,826
Stop pushing me!

657
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:29,546
Ippolit, wait!

658
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,386
Something fell on me!

659
00:56:31,626 --> 00:56:34,865
If he knew what my name was,
would you stay?

660
00:56:35,106 --> 00:56:37,105
- Stop it!
- Please stay!

661
00:56:37,345 --> 00:56:41,545
I don't know his name either.
I never saw this man before!

662
00:56:41,785 --> 00:56:45,105
Now I believe you.
The modern morals!

663
00:56:45,345 --> 00:56:49,105
Why are you dropping me
all the time?

664
00:56:49,345 --> 00:56:52,345
I hurt my shoulder.

665
00:56:52,584 --> 00:56:54,504
I am leaving now.

666
00:56:54,784 --> 00:56:57,784
Let us not ruin the evening.

667
00:56:58,024 --> 00:57:00,224
Don't make me answer for something

668
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:03,944
I haven't done.

669
00:57:04,783 --> 00:57:07,984
Some debauchee
broke into my apartment!

670
00:57:08,223 --> 00:57:09,943
I'm not a debauchee, I'm a doctor.

671
00:57:10,223 --> 00:57:13,703
Supposing he got
to Leningrad by mistake,

672
00:57:13,943 --> 00:57:15,343
And he has the same address.

673
00:57:15,583 --> 00:57:18,743
- But why did you let him in?
- I didn't!

674
00:57:18,983 --> 00:57:22,942
You've got to believe her!
I came in myself.

675
00:57:23,182 --> 00:57:28,022
- My key fit.
- You gave him the key?

676
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:30,982
She didn't. Jesus, you're stupid!

677
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,021
Stop pushing me around.
Some pushy people.

678
00:57:35,261 --> 00:57:37,061
Why don't you believe me?

679
00:57:37,302 --> 00:57:39,301
Why don't you believe us?

680
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:42,661
I find this character
as disgusting as you do.

681
00:57:42,901 --> 00:57:45,021
Right now I find myself
disgusting too.

682
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,500
I'm sorry.

683
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,741
Good bye.

684
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,499
The house looks just the same.

685
00:58:28,098 --> 00:58:31,857
Excuse me,
how do I get to the airport?

686
00:58:32,418 --> 00:58:35,538
Bus No. 30 stops round the corner.

687
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:41,138
- Is this really Leningrad?
- You shouldn't drink so much.

688
00:59:50,093 --> 00:59:51,813
Please don't be sulky with me.

689
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,892
And don't be jealous.

690
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,892
If I fall in love with someone,
you will be the first to know.

691
01:00:00,772 --> 01:00:02,572
"Don't be jealous".

692
01:00:04,731 --> 01:00:10,211
I'm not angry with you,
but you have to understand me too.

693
01:00:10,452 --> 01:00:13,371
- Here I come to you, and I see...
- I understand.

694
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,851
I understand very well.

695
01:00:16,091 --> 01:00:19,770
I'd kick up a row myself,
if I were in your place!

696
01:00:20,011 --> 01:00:24,170
The fact that he appeared
in your house is typical of you.

697
01:00:24,411 --> 01:00:27,251
- Why is that?
- You are sloppy.

698
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,970
Don't say anything.
You are disorganized.

699
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,210
He would hardly show up at my place.

700
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,010
I wouldn't be surprised
if you hadn't found him at all.

701
01:00:35,249 --> 01:00:36,970
Who cares what rags
are lying about the place!

702
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,849
You're right.
I didn't see him at first.

703
01:00:43,769 --> 01:00:47,129
Real French perfume!

704
01:00:51,768 --> 01:00:55,888
- It's so expensive!
- It's nothing.

705
01:00:56,849 --> 01:01:01,128
- I have a present for you too.
- Not another one?

706
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:15,927
Here. An electric shaver,
the latest model.

707
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:18,127
Nadya, you didn't have to!

708
01:01:18,367 --> 01:01:20,926
With sliding blades.

709
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:23,566
It's too expensive.

710
01:01:24,567 --> 01:01:26,047
I follow your example.

711
01:01:27,246 --> 01:01:31,886
I forgot to put on my evening dress!

712
01:01:33,206 --> 01:01:35,846
I won't be long.

713
01:01:44,765 --> 01:01:46,245
Don't peep!

714
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:17,083
You shouldn't drink so much!

715
01:02:17,323 --> 01:02:19,323
You shouldn't drink so much!

716
01:02:45,642 --> 01:02:47,441
It becomes you.

717
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:50,561
I'm glad you like it.

718
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:53,281
Very much.

719
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:05,400
Let's see out the past year.

720
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,920
It was the year I met you.

721
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:15,159
And I met you.

722
01:03:37,758 --> 01:03:40,758
It is my favorite holiday!

723
01:03:43,238 --> 01:03:44,637
Nadya...

724
01:03:48,317 --> 01:03:49,557
Yes?

725
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:56,397
Nadya, darling, I have a...

726
01:03:58,236 --> 01:04:00,276
I have a favor to ask.

727
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:07,236
Here...

728
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:14,275
I love it when you sing.

729
01:04:14,635 --> 01:04:17,955
It's just that you are not impartial
towards me.

730
01:04:24,075 --> 01:04:25,314
You bet!

731
01:04:27,755 --> 01:04:29,914
You bet I'm not impartial!

732
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:42,634
It's been many years now,
that along my street

733
01:04:43,834 --> 01:04:49,393
I hear footsteps.
Those are my friends leaving.

734
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:57,432
The slow lingering
sound of my friends' footsteps

735
01:04:58,993 --> 01:05:03,992
Are absorbed by the darkness outside.

736
01:05:05,312 --> 01:05:09,632
Oh, loneliness,
you are so harsh on me.

737
01:05:10,312 --> 01:05:13,231
Flashing your iron compasses,

738
01:05:14,072 --> 01:05:17,711
Cold-bloodedly
you close the circle,

739
01:05:18,151 --> 01:05:23,631
Paying no attention
to useless pleas.

740
01:05:24,831 --> 01:05:29,190
Let me rise on tiptoe in your forest,

741
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:35,270
At the other end
of the slow motion,

742
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:43,309
Find fallen leaves
and bring them close tom my face,

743
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:49,909
And take my loneliness as A bliss.

744
01:05:51,228 --> 01:05:55,629
Give me the silence
of your libraries,

745
01:05:56,268 --> 01:05:59,948
The austere music of your concerts,

746
01:06:00,349 --> 01:06:03,868
And I'll be wise,
and I will forget all those,

747
01:06:04,268 --> 01:06:09,507
Who passed away,
and who are still living.

748
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:15,267
And I will get to know
wisdom and sorrow,

749
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:20,827
Objects will reveal their hidden
meaning to me,

750
01:06:21,547 --> 01:06:26,387
Nature leaning toward my shoulders

751
01:06:27,307 --> 01:06:32,306
Will open its childish secrets.

752
01:06:34,986 --> 01:06:40,986
And only then from out of tears
and darkness,

753
01:06:42,306 --> 01:06:45,945
From out of the poor ignorance
of the past

754
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:52,425
The beautiful faces of my friends

755
01:06:53,424 --> 01:06:58,784
Will flash for an instant,
to dissolve again.

756
01:06:59,305 --> 01:07:04,744
The beautiful faces of my friends

757
01:07:07,304 --> 01:07:12,583
Will flash for an instant,
to dissolve again.

758
01:07:19,063 --> 01:07:22,823
- To whose poem is that written?
- Akhmadulina.

759
01:07:52,221 --> 01:07:54,221
What do you want?

760
01:07:54,981 --> 01:08:00,540
- Salad or roast beef?
- Salad... And roast beef.

761
01:08:03,660 --> 01:08:06,220
Nadya, listen to me...

762
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:13,580
Tonight, on the last night
of the year I intend

763
01:08:15,139 --> 01:08:17,860
to put the question point-blank.

764
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:21,299
I think

765
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:25,698
we have to get this unmarried
situation over and done with.

766
01:08:27,058 --> 01:08:29,059
What do you think?

767
01:08:31,218 --> 01:08:33,858
I think it is a wonderful idea.

768
01:08:35,378 --> 01:08:39,738
Only on one condition:
that you will not be jealous of me.

769
01:08:41,337 --> 01:08:46,497
You see, I'm not that young
anymore, and I feel...

770
01:08:49,617 --> 01:08:50,617
Who is that?

771
01:08:52,617 --> 01:08:54,777
I haven't the slightest idea.

772
01:08:55,057 --> 01:08:56,737
Excuse me!

773
01:08:57,536 --> 01:08:58,777
I beg your pardon.

774
01:09:08,575 --> 01:09:12,855
I'm sorry, I wouldn't dream
of using my own key.

775
01:09:14,136 --> 01:09:16,376
What is it you want now?

776
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:18,695
You see, it so happens...

777
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:21,935
I don't know anyone in this city,
except you.

778
01:09:22,495 --> 01:09:23,895
And I have no money.

779
01:09:24,135 --> 01:09:26,695
Not a copeck, as it appears.

780
01:09:28,135 --> 01:09:30,134
And they won't sell me a ticket
without money.

781
01:09:34,014 --> 01:09:37,014
Could I borrow 15-16 Rubles from you?

782
01:09:37,254 --> 01:09:39,454
I'll send you the money
first thing tomorrow.

783
01:09:39,694 --> 01:09:41,694
Through wire transfer.

784
01:09:43,174 --> 01:09:46,973
Looks like I will have to pay you
to leave us alone.

785
01:09:47,213 --> 01:09:49,213
Please do.

786
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:53,493
And now I ask you as a man:
What were you doing here?

787
01:09:53,733 --> 01:09:55,173
- Here?
- Yes, here.

788
01:09:55,413 --> 01:09:59,253
For God's sake, calm down.
I will explain everything.

789
01:09:59,533 --> 01:10:01,532
You see, we have this tradition.

790
01:10:01,773 --> 01:10:06,172
Every year on December 31 me
and my friends go to the bathhouse.

791
01:10:06,412 --> 01:10:10,292
We wash ourselves.
It's been many years now.

792
01:10:10,732 --> 01:10:15,371
After that Pavel was to go
to Leningrad.

793
01:10:15,612 --> 01:10:17,972
And I was planning
on getting married.

794
01:10:18,771 --> 01:10:19,771
To whom?

795
01:10:21,131 --> 01:10:22,451
To whom?

796
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:26,891
That's not the point now.

797
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:29,131
In the bathhouse we had a drink.

798
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:32,970
To my fiancee, to me.

799
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:34,931
Are you an alcoholic?

800
01:10:35,211 --> 01:10:37,210
No, I don't drink at all.

801
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:42,810
I drink tea, coffee, liquid yogurt,..

802
01:10:43,049 --> 01:10:45,530
soft drinks, water...

803
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:50,329
- Nadya? please.
- Don't overdo it!

804
01:10:50,569 --> 01:10:51,889
I am absolutely calm!

805
01:10:52,129 --> 01:10:56,969
After the bath
we went to the airport.

806
01:10:57,208 --> 01:11:01,169
Then we had some more to drink,
but that part I don't remember.

807
01:11:01,808 --> 01:11:07,568
I think they must have put me on
that plane instead of Pavel.

808
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:10,648
I swear to God!

809
01:11:10,888 --> 01:11:14,128
- It's as simple as that.
- Yes. And very truthful.

810
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:17,727
- What did you do in the plane?
- I flew.

811
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:20,407
- Flew?
- Sleeping.

812
01:11:22,527 --> 01:11:24,127
I slept...

813
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:27,967
Supposing you don't remember
how you got on that plane.

814
01:11:28,207 --> 01:11:31,246
But you have to remember
how you got out of it.

815
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,566
Yes! I have to.

816
01:11:36,286 --> 01:11:37,766
But I don't.

817
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:42,005
But I do remember
that I came here by cab.

818
01:11:42,325 --> 01:11:46,925
I said my home address,
and the driver brought me here.

819
01:11:47,925 --> 01:11:50,285
Supposing the key fit.

820
01:11:50,526 --> 01:11:51,725
Nadya, please...

821
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:55,645
Supposing the key fit,
the address was the same,

822
01:11:55,885 --> 01:12:00,365
but you had to notice,
that the furniture was different!

823
01:12:00,645 --> 01:12:01,885
It's the same!

824
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:06,564
But there's a mess here,
because the people have just moved in.

825
01:12:06,804 --> 01:12:10,444
We've also just moved in!
Me and my mother.

826
01:12:10,684 --> 01:12:14,844
That's enough!
Here's 15 Rubles, now leave.

827
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:17,164
You don't know how grateful I am,
friends!

828
01:12:17,403 --> 01:12:20,323
You have to pay for your pleasures.

829
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,843
I can't leave
without kissing you good-buy!

830
01:12:25,523 --> 01:12:28,043
You could have at least
waited until I leave.

831
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:33,162
- Ippolit, wait!
- Who do you take me for, an idiot?

832
01:12:36,803 --> 01:12:37,802
Ippolit!

833
01:12:49,521 --> 01:12:51,721
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.

834
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:53,441
What truth?

835
01:12:53,681 --> 01:12:58,401
Would you please help me
to my feet.

836
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,360
I wore myself out with you folks.

837
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,681
I told him, we go to this bathhouse.

838
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,560
On December 31.
It's a tradition we have. We wash every year.

839
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,680
That's exactly what I told him.

840
01:13:15,919 --> 01:13:21,160
Please don't cry.

841
01:13:21,559 --> 01:13:24,719
I'll go get him. Ippolit!

842
01:13:33,718 --> 01:13:36,158
Wait, don't leave!

843
01:13:37,518 --> 01:13:41,798
Ippolit! Sorry, I don't know
your patronymic.

844
01:13:42,438 --> 01:13:43,558
Wait!

845
01:13:43,798 --> 01:13:47,398
Don't leave! Wait!

846
01:13:48,797 --> 01:13:51,678
Don't bee a fool!

847
01:13:52,118 --> 01:13:55,517
Be a man, for Christ's sake!

848
01:14:27,555 --> 01:14:29,035
He left.

849
01:14:31,394 --> 01:14:33,874
He drives faster than I run.

850
01:14:34,794 --> 01:14:36,795
Here, take your 15 Rubles.

851
01:14:37,034 --> 01:14:39,634
Thank you,
I'll wire the money tomorrow.

852
01:14:39,874 --> 01:14:43,794
I hate you. You ruined my life.

853
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:48,714
He will come back, believe me.
You'll see.

854
01:14:48,953 --> 01:14:51,954
The hot-tempered and the jealous
don't bear grudges for too long.

855
01:14:52,714 --> 01:14:54,953
If you only knew,
how well I understand you.

856
01:14:56,193 --> 01:14:58,193
My situation is even worse.

857
01:14:58,433 --> 01:15:01,793
A woman is waiting for me
in Moscow in an empty apartment.

858
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:04,272
The woman I love.

859
01:15:05,353 --> 01:15:07,352
And here I am, in Leningrad.

860
01:15:07,672 --> 01:15:08,792
And?

861
01:15:09,112 --> 01:15:11,312
She doesn't know where you are?

862
01:15:11,552 --> 01:15:13,032
No, she must be hysterical.

863
01:15:13,272 --> 01:15:15,992
- Call her.
- I don't have a telephone card.

864
01:15:16,232 --> 01:15:19,551
Call credit. Through the operator.

865
01:15:20,871 --> 01:15:22,591
You are a sympathetic person.

866
01:15:22,912 --> 01:15:25,951
- Do you mind if I take my coat off?
- Whatever.

867
01:15:26,191 --> 01:15:27,431
Thank you.

868
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:37,071
Operator!

869
01:15:37,351 --> 01:15:40,350
Happy New Year!

870
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:42,110
I need to make a phone call.

871
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:43,630
To Moscow.

872
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:49,509
Number in Moscow? 454-60-21.

873
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:54,229
Who will answer? Galya.

874
01:15:56,949 --> 01:15:59,549
That is, if she answers.

875
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,349
In Leningrad? One moment please.

876
01:16:08,948 --> 01:16:10,348
Stay there!

877
01:16:10,588 --> 01:16:15,707
- What is your number?
- 14-50-30.

878
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:20,907
Operator! 14-50-30.

879
01:16:25,427 --> 01:16:26,707
When?

880
01:16:28,707 --> 01:16:30,067
Can you make it faster?

881
01:16:47,586 --> 01:16:49,185
She said, within an hour.

882
01:16:51,506 --> 01:16:52,745
Oh, God...

883
01:16:53,706 --> 01:16:56,905
I'll wait on the landing, and you
will call me.

884
01:16:58,705 --> 01:17:03,145
Or you can explain everything
yourself.

885
01:17:03,425 --> 01:17:04,664
And I'll go.

886
01:17:04,905 --> 01:17:07,504
Oh no, you sort out your own
problems.

887
01:17:29,063 --> 01:17:31,782
2 minutes to go before the New
Year.

888
01:17:35,182 --> 01:17:37,183
Open the Champagne.

889
01:17:40,702 --> 01:17:42,862
It's in the fridge.

890
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:24,739
No luck again. It's just not my day!

891
01:18:27,259 --> 01:18:28,699
I'm sorry.

892
01:18:36,419 --> 01:18:38,059
Happy New Year.

893
01:18:41,058 --> 01:18:42,538
What's your name?

894
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:45,698
Nadya.

895
01:18:46,858 --> 01:18:48,538
I'm Zhenya.

896
01:18:49,098 --> 01:18:51,178
Happy New Year, Nadya.

897
01:18:53,017 --> 01:18:54,617
Same to you.

898
01:20:17,772 --> 01:20:20,132
What a good beginning of a new
year.

899
01:20:22,092 --> 01:20:23,412
Couldn't be better.

900
01:20:24,531 --> 01:20:25,771
That's true.

901
01:20:32,450 --> 01:20:34,090
There is an omen:

902
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:38,331
You will live through the new year
the same way you see it in.

903
01:20:44,770 --> 01:20:46,770
What doctor are you?

904
01:20:48,210 --> 01:20:49,610
I'm a surgeon.

905
01:20:52,610 --> 01:20:53,610
And what are you?

906
01:20:54,769 --> 01:20:56,170
A teacher.

907
01:20:57,689 --> 01:20:59,769
I teach Russian and literature.

908
01:21:03,089 --> 01:21:05,089
Literature - that's wonderful.

909
01:21:07,888 --> 01:21:11,528
I have to find out, when's the first
flight to Moscow.

910
01:21:11,769 --> 01:21:16,208
- How do I do that? - There's a
telephone book over there.

911
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:38,046
Hello? Operator? Happy New Year.

912
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:42,606
When is the first flight to Moscow,
please?

913
01:21:46,486 --> 01:21:47,966
That's the first one?

914
01:21:53,685 --> 01:21:55,645
It's at 7 a. m.

915
01:22:00,085 --> 01:22:03,805
Nadya, don't worry. I'll leave as
soon as I talk to Galya.

916
01:22:04,284 --> 01:22:07,925
I'm beginning to think, you will
never leave here.

917
01:22:17,404 --> 01:22:20,084
Please don't worry.

918
01:22:21,843 --> 01:22:23,844
Everything will be fine.

919
01:22:24,404 --> 01:22:25,884
There's Moscow now!

920
01:22:26,123 --> 01:22:27,844
Moscow?!

921
01:22:35,443 --> 01:22:37,922
I think it was Ippolit.

922
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:39,883
- Who?
- Ippolit.

923
01:22:41,762 --> 01:22:44,842
Why did you have to pick it up? Who
asked you to?

924
01:22:45,083 --> 01:22:48,242
How was I supposed to know? I
thought it was Moscow.

925
01:22:49,202 --> 01:22:51,202
I'm terribly sorry.

926
01:23:01,481 --> 01:23:03,161
Hello! Hello!

927
01:23:04,681 --> 01:23:05,681
Leningrad?

928
01:23:06,401 --> 01:23:08,041
I'll answer it!

929
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:16,680
Hello? Yes, Moscow.

930
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,520
Moscow? Hello!

931
01:23:19,879 --> 01:23:21,200
Would you please.

932
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,519
- Galya, darling, it's me.
- You are in Leningrad?

933
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:28,840
Thanks for calling anyway.

934
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,479
Galya, Happy...

935
01:23:34,279 --> 01:23:36,118
Happy New Year.

936
01:23:36,718 --> 01:23:39,919
You called to wish me a Happy New
Year?

937
01:23:40,398 --> 01:23:42,999
- Not only that.
- I'm touched.

938
01:23:43,238 --> 01:23:45,238
I will explain everything.

939
01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:47,878
Wait till you hear this incredible
story.

940
01:23:48,118 --> 01:23:51,038
You won't believe it.

941
01:23:51,277 --> 01:23:54,677
I was so worried, I called all city
hospitals and morgues.

942
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:56,917
And you simply ran away from me.

943
01:23:57,158 --> 01:23:58,918
I love you very much.

944
01:23:59,837 --> 01:24:02,797
Now I understand why you told me
about Leningrad.

945
01:24:03,037 --> 01:24:06,036
This is a different story.

946
01:24:06,277 --> 01:24:08,396
It has nothing to do with you.

947
01:24:08,637 --> 01:24:11,636
Every year on December 31 my
friends and I go to a bathhouse.

948
01:24:11,877 --> 01:24:13,716
It's an old tradition.

949
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:17,316
There's nothing more to talk about.

950
01:24:17,556 --> 01:24:21,116
You can check. My number is
14-50-30.

951
01:24:21,355 --> 01:24:23,316
I'm taking the first flight to
Moscow.

952
01:24:23,555 --> 01:24:25,556
No need to be in a hurry.

953
01:24:26,596 --> 01:24:28,676
I'll leave the key on the table.

954
01:24:28,915 --> 01:24:32,795
No, please! Don't leave it!

955
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:20,832
That's for me! Don't answer it!
Galya!

956
01:25:22,231 --> 01:25:24,352
3 minutes? Thank you.

957
01:25:31,671 --> 01:25:33,391
Well, that's it.

958
01:25:34,911 --> 01:25:36,871
I don't have a fiancee any more.

959
01:25:37,911 --> 01:25:40,670
No big deal, you'll find yourself
another one.

960
01:25:42,951 --> 01:25:46,910
Another one? What do you know
about it?

961
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:51,750
All my life I've been looking for the
right woman.

962
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:55,669
I was never married.

963
01:25:57,749 --> 01:25:59,589
And now finally when I found her...

964
01:26:01,429 --> 01:26:03,429
Why are you raising your voice at
me?

965
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:06,428
I've had enough of your stupid
advice.

966
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:08,788
Don't forget, you are at my place.

967
01:26:09,909 --> 01:26:12,388
The hell with your stupid apartment!

968
01:26:12,628 --> 01:26:14,509
Together with your stupid Otello!

969
01:26:14,748 --> 01:26:16,068
Impudent boor!

970
01:26:16,308 --> 01:26:17,508
You are a boor.

971
01:26:18,068 --> 01:26:19,668
Well if I am a boor, you are...

972
01:26:19,908 --> 01:26:23,588
What am I? Get out!

973
01:26:30,347 --> 01:26:33,507
I'm not going anywhere.

974
01:26:33,747 --> 01:26:36,227
- The flight is at 7 a.m.
- Then I will leave.

975
01:26:36,467 --> 01:26:39,427
Good riddance! I'm hungry as hell.

976
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:43,227
- Oh no you don't!
- I'm hungry!

977
01:26:49,186 --> 01:26:51,106
You know, you're a genuine
termagant.

978
01:26:53,905 --> 01:26:58,306
One more word, and the next plate
will crash into your head.

979
01:27:07,545 --> 01:27:09,265
Your Galya left you.

980
01:27:12,904 --> 01:27:14,904
And she did the right thing.

981
01:27:18,544 --> 01:27:21,544
Now she will find a man worthy of
her.

982
01:27:32,063 --> 01:27:34,583
- What?
- What about?

983
01:27:34,823 --> 01:27:36,223
You don't object?

984
01:27:37,143 --> 01:27:38,943
Nothing you can say to that?

985
01:27:39,582 --> 01:27:43,462
No, it's just that I'm afraid of the
next plate.

986
01:27:43,702 --> 01:27:45,062
And you are right.

987
01:27:49,582 --> 01:27:51,502
That's Ippolit.

988
01:27:51,742 --> 01:27:53,382
Jump off the balcony.

989
01:27:53,622 --> 01:27:55,742
I'm not an idiot to fracture my legs.

990
01:27:59,462 --> 01:28:02,421
Happy New Year, Nadya!

991
01:28:02,941 --> 01:28:05,181
We were in the neighborhood and
decided to drop by.

992
01:28:06,141 --> 01:28:08,661
We left my husband downstairs.

993
01:28:08,901 --> 01:28:12,141
- He would sit for ages.
- It's not easy to get rid of a man.

994
01:28:12,381 --> 01:28:14,301
Where is he? Show us.

995
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:26,019
There he is. In all his glory.

996
01:28:40,579 --> 01:28:41,579
Valya.

997
01:28:46,538 --> 01:28:47,778
Tanya.

998
01:28:50,378 --> 01:28:52,858
Dear Ippolit Georgievich!

999
01:28:54,017 --> 01:28:57,257
- We are Nadya's friends.
- We work in the same school.

1000
01:28:57,498 --> 01:29:00,178
She's been hiding you from us.

1001
01:29:00,417 --> 01:29:03,657
We came here to wish you
happiness.

1002
01:29:03,897 --> 01:29:09,577
We want you to know what a
wonderful person she is.

1003
01:29:10,696 --> 01:29:13,857
Everyone loves her: colleagues,
parents and even children.

1004
01:29:14,096 --> 01:29:15,296
She is sympathetic.

1005
01:29:15,536 --> 01:29:19,256
She is socially active and hangs in
the Hall of Fame.

1006
01:29:19,497 --> 01:29:20,736
I'm not the one...

1007
01:29:23,896 --> 01:29:26,816
Don't listen to him! Please sit down.

1008
01:29:27,055 --> 01:29:30,536
- Call your husband.
- We don't want to interfere!

1009
01:29:30,774 --> 01:29:33,936
There's nothing to interfere into. We
hardly know each other.

1010
01:29:34,175 --> 01:29:35,655
What's your patronymic?

1011
01:29:35,935 --> 01:29:37,415
Vasilyevna.

1012
01:29:39,655 --> 01:29:42,814
I've known Nadezhda Vasilyevna
since 11 p.m.

1013
01:29:43,055 --> 01:29:45,813
Ippolit, stop fooling around. That's
enough.

1014
01:29:46,054 --> 01:29:49,415
Let him make jokes. He's good at it.

1015
01:29:49,653 --> 01:29:51,054
But I am not Ipppolit.

1016
01:29:51,294 --> 01:29:54,054
I like your attitude to one another.

1017
01:29:54,292 --> 01:29:56,934
The attitude is rather complex.

1018
01:29:57,173 --> 01:30:00,973
You need a towel, it's going to shoot
out.

1019
01:30:01,213 --> 01:30:02,693
I will be careful.

1020
01:30:08,292 --> 01:30:11,973
Well, friends, here's to your happy
married life!

1021
01:30:12,212 --> 01:30:15,091
Thank you, I'm not drinking.

1022
01:30:15,852 --> 01:30:19,532
- No, no, I won't.
- Yes you will!

1023
01:30:19,773 --> 01:30:22,332
- Have you all gone mad?
- Bottoms up!

1024
01:30:26,372 --> 01:30:30,052
- Well, you have to kiss now!
- Kiss her!

1025
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:33,970
I object! I won't let you make a
laughing-stock of me!

1026
01:30:34,212 --> 01:30:38,210
Get away from me! I don't want to
kiss you!

1027
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:43,409
Let go of me! You have to explain
everything to them!

1028
01:30:43,651 --> 01:30:46,929
Nadya, Nadya, what are you doing?

1029
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:58,409
And even now I still insist, I'm not
Ippolit.

1030
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:01,009
Ippolit Georgievich,

1031
01:31:01,648 --> 01:31:04,089
Do you like to listen to her singing?

1032
01:31:04,329 --> 01:31:05,648
I don't know, I never heard her sing.

1033
01:31:05,889 --> 01:31:09,968
- You never sang to him?
- That's an inexcusable mistake.

1034
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:14,569
- I don't like amateur singing.
- It's not amateur.

1035
01:31:14,808 --> 01:31:18,368
Give us our favorite - "Carriages".

1036
01:31:22,127 --> 01:31:25,527
The train starts off for
Tikhoretskaya.

1037
01:31:25,768 --> 01:31:29,407
The carriage sets off, And the
platform stays behind.

1038
01:31:29,647 --> 01:31:32,686
The brick wall, The station clock,

1039
01:31:33,448 --> 01:31:35,927
White shawls, White shawls,

1040
01:31:36,167 --> 01:31:37,567
White shawls waving,

1041
01:31:38,087 --> 01:31:42,167
White shawls, Sad eyes.

1042
01:31:42,967 --> 01:31:46,407
Passengers in the smoking
Compartment try to worm

1043
01:31:46,806 --> 01:31:50,126
My past and present out of me,

1044
01:31:50,366 --> 01:31:53,165
I'll feed them a load of lies,
Let them wonder,

1045
01:31:54,124 --> 01:31:56,726
But who I said good-bye to,
Who I said good-bye to,

1046
01:31:56,966 --> 01:32:00,006
Who I said good-bye to,
Who I said good-bye to

1047
01:32:00,485 --> 01:32:02,765
Is none of your business.

1048
01:32:04,406 --> 01:32:07,965
A sailor in a stripped vest
Will open his soul to me,

1049
01:32:08,204 --> 01:32:11,605
He'll tell me about his hard Living,

1050
01:32:11,845 --> 01:32:15,243
He'll get off at the next station
And wave good-bye,

1051
01:32:15,564 --> 01:32:18,405
The carriage will set off,
The carriage will set off,

1052
01:32:18,644 --> 01:32:20,004
The carriage will set off,

1053
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:23,723
The carriage will set off,
And he will stay back.

1054
01:32:27,243 --> 01:32:29,642
The train starts off
for Tikhoretskaya,

1055
01:32:30,443 --> 01:32:33,763
The carriage sets off,
And the platform stays behind,

1056
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:37,763
The brick wall,
The station clock,

1057
01:32:38,003 --> 01:32:40,603
White shawls,
White shawls,

1058
01:32:40,841 --> 01:32:42,403
White shawls,

1059
01:32:42,643 --> 01:32:46,362
White shawls,
Sad eyes.

1060
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:48,402
Never heard anything like tha before.

1061
01:32:48,643 --> 01:32:51,922
Guys, I'm enjoying myself!

1062
01:32:52,162 --> 01:32:54,601
Lets go, my man must be
cold out there.

1063
01:32:56,122 --> 01:32:58,522
Nadya and Ippolit, be happy!

1064
01:32:58,761 --> 01:33:01,001
I'm tired of denying it.
I'm not Ippolit.

1065
01:33:01,241 --> 01:33:05,521
All the happiness in the world!
Nadya, let me kiss you.

1066
01:33:05,841 --> 01:33:07,001
We're off!

1067
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:13,241
A good man, serious and reliable.

1068
01:33:15,281 --> 01:33:17,681
God bless you! Happy New Year!

1069
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,800
Why did you do that for?

1070
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:34,040
Did you have to harp on
like a parrot:

1071
01:33:34,278 --> 01:33:36,679
"I'm not Ippolit! I'm not Ippolit!"

1072
01:33:38,039 --> 01:33:41,798
Did you expect me to tell them
about the bathhouse,

1073
01:33:43,958 --> 01:33:46,359
so that tomorrow
the whole school would know,

1074
01:33:46,597 --> 01:33:49,998
that I spent the New Year's eve
with some rogue?

1075
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:51,478
I'm not a rogue.

1076
01:33:53,038 --> 01:33:55,038
I'm a miserable person.

1077
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:59,716
As if a miserable person
can't be a rogue.

1078
01:34:08,036 --> 01:34:11,677
How do you intend
to produce the real Ippolit?

1079
01:34:16,636 --> 01:34:20,515
Most likely there will be
no real one.

1080
01:34:30,275 --> 01:34:33,276
Why do I have to comfort you
all the time?

1081
01:34:34,195 --> 01:34:36,715
Why isn't anyone comforting me?

1082
01:34:37,675 --> 01:34:40,475
My situation is much worse.
At least you are at home.

1083
01:34:40,715 --> 01:34:44,315
- But it is all your fault!
- It was an accident.

1084
01:34:44,555 --> 01:34:47,115
I'm a victim of circumstances myself!

1085
01:34:52,193 --> 01:34:53,434
You mind if I eat something?

1086
01:34:54,113 --> 01:34:56,474
Help yourself.
There's so much food.

1087
01:35:00,193 --> 01:35:02,273
I hate to through it all away.

1088
01:35:02,513 --> 01:35:04,913
I haven't eaten anything
since last year.

1089
01:35:06,874 --> 01:35:08,273
Tastes good!

1090
01:35:10,193 --> 01:35:13,552
- Did you make that yourself?
- Well of course.

1091
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:17,632
Wanted to produce an impression.

1092
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:20,273
And you succeeded.

1093
01:35:22,632 --> 01:35:25,672
I mean to say, I am a gourmet.

1094
01:35:26,312 --> 01:35:28,671
And I hate to cook.

1095
01:35:29,512 --> 01:35:33,790
With my lazy-bones I hardly have
any time for cooking anyway.

1096
01:35:36,431 --> 01:35:38,471
- You teach them?
- Yes.

1097
01:35:40,551 --> 01:35:42,590
And they teach me.

1098
01:35:45,310 --> 01:35:48,871
I try to teach them to think.

1099
01:35:49,830 --> 01:35:51,630
If at least a little.

1100
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:56,230
And have a personal opinion
about everything.

1101
01:35:57,629 --> 01:36:00,349
- Can I have some more?
- Of course.

1102
01:36:02,629 --> 01:36:07,349
- What do they teach you?
- I guess, the same thing.

1103
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:15,068
This is not fish.
This is anything but fish in aspic.

1104
01:36:15,629 --> 01:36:19,509
This is... It needs some
horse-radish to go with.

1105
01:36:21,228 --> 01:36:26,228
And I represent the most
conservative of all professions.

1106
01:36:31,748 --> 01:36:33,867
We can compete there.

1107
01:36:34,107 --> 01:36:35,468
No, I'm serious.

1108
01:36:36,107 --> 01:36:39,907
With us it is dangerous
to have a personal opinion.

1109
01:36:40,147 --> 01:36:42,147
What if it's a wrong one?

1110
01:36:43,427 --> 01:36:46,467
Doctors' mistakes
are extremely costly.

1111
01:36:47,386 --> 01:36:51,667
Teachers' mistakes
are not that obvious,

1112
01:36:52,946 --> 01:36:57,866
But in the end
they are no less costly.

1113
01:36:59,385 --> 01:37:00,946
Maybe you're right.

1114
01:37:01,186 --> 01:37:04,025
Still you and me have the most

1115
01:37:04,786 --> 01:37:07,625
wonderful and the most needed jobs
in the world.

1116
01:37:07,945 --> 01:37:09,624
Not judging by the salaries.

1117
01:37:12,504 --> 01:37:14,225
That's right.

1118
01:37:16,865 --> 01:37:21,024
When your friends were saying
all these good things about you,

1119
01:37:22,625 --> 01:37:25,623
God knows why I felt proud.

1120
01:37:28,464 --> 01:37:29,943
No use wheedling.

1121
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:35,503
By the way, unlike you,
your friend noticed,

1122
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,863
That I'm a reliable serious person.

1123
01:37:38,103 --> 01:37:40,103
You didn't break into her house.

1124
01:37:42,503 --> 01:37:46,742
That's true,
I didn't break into her house yet.

1125
01:37:54,023 --> 01:37:58,022
What an unusual way
to see in the New Year.

1126
01:38:00,101 --> 01:38:03,102
If we ever meet again, by chance,

1127
01:38:05,621 --> 01:38:08,340
I think we will laugh ourselves
to death.

1128
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:11,860
Well, it wasn't funny,

1129
01:38:12,101 --> 01:38:14,621
when I first saw you
sleeping on my sofa.

1130
01:38:15,501 --> 01:38:16,900
What about me?

1131
01:38:24,499 --> 01:38:28,499
Imagine me waking up at home

1132
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:33,099
and seeing a strange woman,
who pours water over me.

1133
01:38:33,340 --> 01:38:36,338
And crying: "Get out of here!"

1134
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:41,099
I cried back: "Get out yourself!"

1135
01:38:42,619 --> 01:38:45,338
I was so indignant,
I didn't know what to do.

1136
01:38:45,579 --> 01:38:47,578
Who is this man?

1137
01:38:48,458 --> 01:38:51,138
If he's a thief,
then why did he go to sleep?

1138
01:38:51,377 --> 01:38:56,657
He got tired and went to sleep
in the home, he had just robbed?

1139
01:38:57,858 --> 01:39:01,498
You know, I didn't like you at first.

1140
01:39:03,098 --> 01:39:07,737
And you looked utterly disgusting!

1141
01:39:12,857 --> 01:39:15,017
I can imagine!

1142
01:39:30,095 --> 01:39:31,335
Shall I open it?

1143
01:39:43,615 --> 01:39:46,734
End of Part One.

1144
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:51,840
25.000

1145
01:39:56,240 --> 01:40:00,640
MOSFILM studio

1146
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,080
THE IRONY OF FATE,

1147
01:40:03,320 --> 01:40:06,080
OR SAUNA BLUES

1148
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:08,920
Part Two

1149
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:18,120
Imagine me waking up at home
in my own bed,

1150
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:21,920
and seeing some strange woman
pouring water over me.

1151
01:40:22,160 --> 01:40:24,760
I shout at her:
"You get out of here!"

1152
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:30,480
And I say:
"No, I won't! You get out yourself!"

1153
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,800
"Get out of my house!"

1154
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,960
I was so indignant,
I didn't know what to do.

1155
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:44,640
Who are you? If you're a thief,
then why did you go to sleep?

1156
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:49,360
A thief that went to bed in the
house, he had just robbed?

1157
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,080
You know, Nadya, I didn't like
you at first.

1158
01:40:57,320 --> 01:40:59,880
I really hated you!

1159
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:05,720
And you looked disgusting!
Utterly disgusting!

1160
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:08,880
I thought you were
a real termagant!

1161
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:55,520
Nadya, forgive me.

1162
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,320
I was wrong.
I got a little worked up.

1163
01:41:59,560 --> 01:42:03,080
It's OK. It's a good thing
you came back.

1164
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:04,560
Really?

1165
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,320
- Thank you.
- I thought you will never come back.

1166
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:11,880
Let me take your coat.

1167
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:21,000
Come in.

1168
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:33,040
- He's still here?
- I couldn't turn him out into the cold!

1169
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,800
The first flight is only
at 7 in the morning.

1170
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:40,640
He could spend the night
at the airport. Not a big deal!

1171
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:43,960
Sit down.

1172
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:50,320
- I see you had dinner.
- Didn't make sense to stay hungry!

1173
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:55,400
Music... Well that's cozy.
I like that!

1174
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,240
- Why don't you join us?
- Join you? Thank you very much.

1175
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:01,680
- Don't pick on words.
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

1176
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:04,400
Please, just one minute.

1177
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,720
Let's call a taxi and let him
bugger off to the airport.

1178
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:17,160
On New Year's night a taxi
won't come before morning.

1179
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,240
Then let him walk.

1180
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:22,800
- Walk to the airport?
- Yes, walk to the airport.

1181
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,040
So far away?

1182
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:27,200
Now you're starting to feel
sorry for him.

1183
01:43:28,040 --> 01:43:31,960
Even my boundless patience
has its limits.

1184
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:33,800
Mine too.

1185
01:43:34,720 --> 01:43:37,120
Maybe there was something
between you?

1186
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:38,960
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

1187
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,720
I'm not talking to you!

1188
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:47,160
If you love a woman,
you have to trust her.

1189
01:43:47,400 --> 01:43:49,280
Nadya, bring this character to order.

1190
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:53,240
She is a wonderful woman.
As a person.

1191
01:43:53,480 --> 01:43:56,640
She is intelligent.
She cooks well. I ate!

1192
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:01,680
Bring him to order,
or I don't know what I'll do!

1193
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:05,720
She's tactful.
Above all, she's beautiful.

1194
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:09,720
- I'll kill him!
- You have to apologize to her!

1195
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:12,080
- What are you doing?
- And you?

1196
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,840
Ippolit, stop it!

1197
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,800
Bastard! I'll show you!

1198
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,080
All I need is a fight here!

1199
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:21,920
Apologize to her! You!

1200
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:23,560
I can't stand familiarities!

1201
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:25,080
You are defeated!

1202
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,840
Zhenya, stop it!

1203
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,560
We have to see, who's defeated
here! You'll break my arm!

1204
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:32,080
I'll break it, I'll fix it!

1205
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,240
- Zhenya!
- So he's already Zhenya for you!

1206
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:37,120
What do you expect her to call me?
Vasya?

1207
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:39,080
Let go of my arm!

1208
01:44:39,320 --> 01:44:41,040
Will you stop it!

1209
01:44:41,320 --> 01:44:42,560
Apologize!

1210
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:44,320
That's enough!

1211
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:49,840
Get off me.

1212
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:52,040
I didn't want to beat him up.
He started it.

1213
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:55,440
Now leave, both of you!

1214
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,240
Both of you!

1215
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,120
Well, if that's what you want!

1216
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:09,440
I'll remember this New Year for
as long as I live.

1217
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:13,440
Please do.
Do me a favor, try not to forget it.

1218
01:45:14,040 --> 01:45:17,840
- Please.
- No, no, after you.

1219
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:21,240
- Be so kind as to leave here.
- I'm in no hurry.

1220
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,440
Stop playing the clown!

1221
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:53,800
Tanya, I'll come to your place.

1222
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:57,600
No, nothing happened.

1223
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,120
I'll explain later.

1224
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:07,080
All right, then you drop by.

1225
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:17,880
- Which way are you going?
- That way..

1226
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,520
- Then I'm heading this way.
- We go in different directions.

1227
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:13,440
- Well, well...
- She threw you out.

1228
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,480
She threw both of us out.

1229
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:28,720
Let's stay outside then.
I have plenty of time before my flight.

1230
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:31,400
And today's my day off.

1231
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:41,720
- Can't say it is warm.
- Yes, rather cool.

1232
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:45,600
I've noticed, your underwear
is not fit for winter.

1233
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:48,960
You'll get pneumonia and -
farewell...

1234
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:52,280
- Farewell?
- A lethal outcome.

1235
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,760
And your boots have thin soles.

1236
01:47:56,040 --> 01:47:58,000
- So we'll die together then.
- I don't intend to die.

1237
01:47:58,280 --> 01:48:00,240
I can go sit in the car.

1238
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,320
Ippolit Georgievich,
what are you thinking about?

1239
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,560
I don't have to account
for my thoughts.

1240
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,840
Somehow I can tell,
you're thinking about me.

1241
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:17,400
Yes, I am thinking about you,
adventurer.

1242
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:20,400
You have no respect for anything.

1243
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:23,040
People like you always pry
into other people's affairs.

1244
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:25,080
They believe in impulse,
not in common sense.

1245
01:48:25,360 --> 01:48:26,480
You are uncontrollable!

1246
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:31,600
Your actions are guided not by
reason, but by unruly passions.

1247
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:33,360
You constitute social danger.

1248
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,280
What a flattering description.

1249
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:40,680
- What are you thinking about?
- Hot tea.

1250
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:44,600
How about frankness in exchange
for frankness.

1251
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,120
All right.

1252
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:50,720
People like you are always right,

1253
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,480
because you live the right way.

1254
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,040
According to instructions.

1255
01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:57,040
But that is your weak point.

1256
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:01,280
You're not capable of acting on
an impulse or doing great things.

1257
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,480
But you can't fit life into
a perfect scheme.

1258
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:20,400
- That's it!
- What?

1259
01:49:20,640 --> 01:49:23,640
I have to return. I forgot my bag.

1260
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:27,040
- You did that on purpose!
- Why did I have to freeze out here?

1261
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,840
I'll get your bag for you.

1262
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:31,880
I don't trust you. I have
an expensive birch switch in it.

1263
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:36,480
- Why did you go to the bath?
- You won't understand.

1264
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:45,680
Hello! Moscow? Galya?

1265
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:50,360
Yes. Can I speak with Lukashine?

1266
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,960
He left for the airport.

1267
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:55,920
Just a stranger.

1268
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,120
Tell me, how did he end up
at your place?

1269
01:50:00,840 --> 01:50:03,280
I'll explain everything.

1270
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,760
Last night Zhenya
went to a bathhouse.

1271
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:12,320
What are you talking about?
He has a bath at home.

1272
01:50:13,520 --> 01:50:14,720
It's a tradition they have.

1273
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:19,760
Every year he and his school
friends...

1274
01:50:34,360 --> 01:50:36,760
You've known each other for
many years?

1275
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:40,440
No, we met several hours ago.

1276
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:44,400
My home address
is the same as his in Moscow.

1277
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:47,720
Apt. 12, 25, 3rd Constructors St.

1278
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:50,440
And he came here thinking,
it was his home.

1279
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:55,880
So you know his Moscow address.

1280
01:50:57,240 --> 01:50:58,640
Please...

1281
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,960
Calm down.

1282
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:12,160
Don't order me about.

1283
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:17,600
- Let me help you.
- I don't want any help from you.

1284
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:24,200
My hands are cold.

1285
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,640
It's as simple as that.

1286
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:31,360
You crook.

1287
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,200
No, you got the wrong idea.

1288
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,920
Galya, don't hang up, please.

1289
01:51:41,080 --> 01:51:44,080
Zhenya is a very good man,
a very kind one.

1290
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:49,200
I must admit, I envy you, Galya.

1291
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:51,640
Yes, I do like him a lot.

1292
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:53,400
You must forgive him.

1293
01:52:09,040 --> 01:52:11,480
Why are you defending him?

1294
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:12,880
Are you married?

1295
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:16,040
What does that have to do with it?

1296
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:18,360
You're not then.

1297
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:22,760
So he flew to Leningrad
to see in the New Year with you.

1298
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:27,120
- How old are you?
- Not very young.

1299
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:31,040
- Your last chance?
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1300
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:33,000
Me? Ashamed?

1301
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,880
I didn't steel your fiance.

1302
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:40,440
Galya, you got it all wrong!

1303
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,240
You are a vamp.

1304
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:48,040
In the end at the last moment
he'll dump you too.

1305
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:15,880
I'm sorry.

1306
01:53:17,120 --> 01:53:21,880
I'm terribly sorry, but I left
my bag with the birch switch.

1307
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:24,800
Galya called.

1308
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:26,520
Galya?

1309
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:30,400
How did she find out the number?

1310
01:53:32,040 --> 01:53:38,040
Oh yes, I told her myself.
And you have a simple number.

1311
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:41,960
I tried to explain everything,
but she didn't believe me.

1312
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,920
I told her you left to the airport.

1313
01:53:48,120 --> 01:53:49,440
I see...

1314
01:53:51,640 --> 01:53:53,040
Yes, thank you.

1315
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:00,960
Well, I'll be going now.

1316
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:06,160
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

1317
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:16,240
Once again sorry for the intrusion.

1318
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:20,000
- Thank you.
- That was nothing.

1319
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:30,160
I'm off...

1320
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,720
I just wanted to say...

1321
01:54:38,280 --> 01:54:39,520
What?

1322
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,840
Can I call you some time?

1323
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:48,880
Do you remember my phone number?

1324
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,080
14-50-30.

1325
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,200
Call me.

1326
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:01,080
- Happy New Year!
- Thank you.

1327
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:04,720
- Happy New Year to you too.
- Thank you.

1328
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:11,000
Well... I'm off.

1329
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:15,880
But how will you get to the airport?

1330
01:55:18,760 --> 01:55:21,960
- Buses don't run yet.
- I'll get there somehow.

1331
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:24,920
Go then.

1332
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:27,920
Go.

1333
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,720
What are you doing?

1334
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:40,960
I'm leaving.

1335
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:43,920
You're looking for a pretext to stay.

1336
01:55:44,280 --> 01:55:46,640
Yes, I am. But I can't find one.

1337
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:51,680
And I can't find
a pretext to delay you.

1338
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:54,920
- What shall we do?
- Really?

1339
01:55:59,480 --> 01:56:02,520
Then I'll take off my coat
and stay for awhile.

1340
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:19,480
Sit down please.

1341
01:56:28,520 --> 01:56:31,080
- Here, let me take it.
- No, no, it's all right.

1342
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:42,480
- Want some herring?
- No, no, thank you.

1343
01:56:53,200 --> 01:56:54,840
Maybe Champagne?

1344
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:06,280
I would like to sing for you.

1345
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,160
Please do.

1346
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:14,320
Because the pause is too long?

1347
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:17,960
Perhaps.

1348
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:21,800
I don't sing very well,
but I like to sing.

1349
01:57:34,760 --> 01:57:39,200
"If you don't have an aunt".

1350
01:57:40,240 --> 01:57:41,480
Performed by...

1351
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,800
Let it be
"The aria of the Moscow visitor".

1352
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:03,640
If you don't have a house,

1353
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:06,840
It can not be destroyed by a Fire,

1354
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:10,360
And your wife will not leave
you for another,

1355
01:58:11,160 --> 01:58:16,880
If you don't, if you don't
If you don't have a wife,

1356
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,080
If you don't have a wife.

1357
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:24,000
If you don't have a dog,

1358
01:58:24,480 --> 01:58:27,160
It won't be poisoned
by your neighbour.

1359
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,800
You will never get into a fight
with your friend,

1360
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:37,000
If you don't, if you don't,
if you don't have a friend,

1361
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:40,520
If you don't have a friend.

1362
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:44,520
The orchestra is playing bass,

1363
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:47,480
The trumpet-player
is blowing his brass,

1364
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:54,240
Think for yourself,
decide for yourself: to have or not to have.

1365
01:58:55,240 --> 01:58:57,880
If you don't have an aunt,

1366
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:00,720
You won't lose her,

1367
01:59:01,760 --> 01:59:04,560
And if you don't live,

1368
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:08,280
You won't die,

1369
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,000
You won't die,

1370
01:59:12,240 --> 01:59:14,640
You won't die.

1371
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:18,280
The orchestra is playing bass,

1372
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:21,400
The trumpet-player blows his brass.

1373
01:59:22,240 --> 01:59:28,080
Think for yourself,
decide for yourself: to have or not to have.

1374
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:31,400
To have or not to have.

1375
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,800
That's all.

1376
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:39,360
A philosophical song.

1377
01:59:39,680 --> 01:59:41,920
I took the guitar with
a certain idea in mind.

1378
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:45,720
Now you as a hospitable hostess
have to sing for me.

1379
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:52,600
But you said you didn't like
my singing.

1380
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:56,560
I like it. I lied. I lie.

1381
01:59:57,800 --> 01:59:59,040
All the time?

1382
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,240
Almost.

1383
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:11,160
A beautiful photograph.

1384
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:18,360
I like it too. Even though
it was made almost 10 years ago.

1385
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:20,000
Ten years?

1386
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,600
You haven't changed a bit.

1387
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:25,640
You're lying again?

1388
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:29,400
Well, almost.

1389
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:41,400
- Where do you work?
- At an outpatients clinic.

1390
02:00:42,160 --> 02:00:43,480
I receive patients.

1391
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:46,000
Sometimes up to 30 a day.

1392
02:00:47,720 --> 02:00:49,040
Do you ever get tired?

1393
02:00:49,600 --> 02:00:53,680
Of course. But they're in pain,
and they need help.

1394
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:57,560
All right, I will sing for you.

1395
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:00,840
Even though you didn't deserve it.

1396
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,200
Thank you so much.

1397
02:01:15,080 --> 02:01:19,560
I like it that you're head over heels
in love with someone else,

1398
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,520
I like it that I'm head over
heels in love with someone else,

1399
02:01:27,960 --> 02:01:31,640
And that the heavy globe of the
Earth will never

1400
02:01:33,960 --> 02:01:37,160
Slide from under our feet.

1401
02:01:39,160 --> 02:01:43,280
I like it that I can be funny

1402
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,160
And loose,
And not play with words,

1403
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:53,200
And not blush
with a suffocating wave

1404
02:01:53,720 --> 02:01:57,840
When slightly brushing
sleeves with you.

1405
02:02:00,480 --> 02:02:03,960
I thank you
from the bottom of my heart

1406
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:08,800
For loving me so,
without knowing it.

1407
02:02:10,600 --> 02:02:12,120
For my quiet nights,

1408
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,840
For the scarcity of our encounters
in the hours of dawn,

1409
02:02:16,120 --> 02:02:21,760
For the moon and the sun
not shining above our heads,

1410
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:27,600
For you being in love, alas,
with someone else,

1411
02:02:30,120 --> 02:02:34,800
For me being in love, alas,
with someone else, alas,

1412
02:02:41,640 --> 02:02:42,880
Nadya...

1413
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:51,600
I want to ask you something...

1414
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:58,280
A want to ask you a favor.
You may find it too daring...

1415
02:02:58,520 --> 02:02:59,840
But what is it?

1416
02:03:02,320 --> 02:03:05,280
You... won't be mad at me?

1417
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:08,040
I'll try.

1418
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:10,240
And you won't send me away?

1419
02:03:11,080 --> 02:03:13,640
Well, if I haven't done it so far...

1420
02:03:13,880 --> 02:03:16,720
- You want me to sing another song?
- No.

1421
02:03:22,120 --> 02:03:26,200
May I take out Ippolit's photograph

1422
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:28,600
and tear it to pieces?

1423
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:31,720
No, you may not.

1424
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:36,440
Are you really
very unhappy that he left?

1425
02:03:39,640 --> 02:03:42,640
- Why do you need to know that?
- I have my reasons..

1426
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:46,640
Yes, I am unhappy.

1427
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:49,240
Are you sure?

1428
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:05,880
How old are you? 32?

1429
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:11,080
- Thirty three?
- Thirty four.

1430
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,000
Thirty four?

1431
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:19,480
And still no family.

1432
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,880
No luck. That happens.

1433
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:25,920
And suddenly there comes He.

1434
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:28,200
All positive...

1435
02:04:29,720 --> 02:04:32,160
Serious and reliable.

1436
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,200
Handsome.

1437
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,040
Next to him you feel comfortable.

1438
02:04:38,600 --> 02:04:39,800
Protected.

1439
02:04:40,280 --> 02:04:42,400
As though behind a thick stone wall.

1440
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:46,880
He's well off, and your friends
are giving their piece of advice:

1441
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,360
"Don't let him get away!"

1442
02:04:50,600 --> 02:04:52,800
You can be cruel.

1443
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:55,880
I'm sorry.

1444
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:06,120
I'm a surgeon, there are times
when I have to cause people pain,

1445
02:05:06,360 --> 02:05:09,320
so that later on they would
be happy.

1446
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:12,520
Do you ever feel sorry
for your patients?

1447
02:05:15,160 --> 02:05:16,360
Of course I do.

1448
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,000
Yes...

1449
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,360
Sometimes I feel sorry
for myself too.

1450
02:05:27,240 --> 02:05:28,560
I come home,..

1451
02:05:30,080 --> 02:05:33,320
sit in the armchair
and start feeling sorry for myself.

1452
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:38,600
But that doesn't happen so often.

1453
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:42,680
Have you ever been married?

1454
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,200
I was. Half-married.

1455
02:05:47,640 --> 02:05:49,360
How's that? By what half?

1456
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:55,480
That happens...
We met twice a week.

1457
02:05:57,880 --> 02:05:59,640
That went on for ten years.

1458
02:06:02,360 --> 02:06:05,760
And on weekends I was alone.

1459
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:12,480
Since that time
I don't like weekends.

1460
02:06:13,480 --> 02:06:15,200
And I don't like holidays.

1461
02:06:18,840 --> 02:06:20,080
He was married?

1462
02:06:24,120 --> 02:06:25,680
He still is.

1463
02:06:28,600 --> 02:06:30,520
Do you still love him?

1464
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,360
No.

1465
02:06:36,440 --> 02:06:37,680
No.

1466
02:06:38,600 --> 02:06:40,400
Let's go have some coffee.

1467
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:56,440
You know,
I was never popular with women.

1468
02:06:57,040 --> 02:06:59,280
It started at school.
No, honestly.

1469
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:03,520
There was this girl, Ira.
She was nothing special.

1470
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:07,680
And as they say,
I had a crush on her.

1471
02:07:08,440 --> 02:07:11,520
And she didn't even notice me.

1472
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:15,280
Then after we graduated,
she married Pavel.

1473
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:17,440
The one you went
to the bathhouse with?

1474
02:07:17,680 --> 02:07:20,560
And instead of whom
you flew to Leningrad?

1475
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:25,320
Yes. They got married
and invited me to their wedding.

1476
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:28,120
I was very upset,
and I proposed a toast:

1477
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:32,480
"Ira, I wish you to leave Pavel
and come to live with me"

1478
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:36,200
They threw me out, of course.

1479
02:07:36,440 --> 02:07:40,960
- And now you are friends?
- We've been friends all our life.

1480
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:44,040
It's not his fault
that she preferred him.

1481
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:48,160
He was going to fly to Leningrad

1482
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:50,240
to see in the New Year with her.

1483
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:56,720
Poor Ira, another victim
of the situation.

1484
02:07:57,960 --> 02:07:59,440
Why "another"?

1485
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:04,440
I don't consider myself a victim.

1486
02:08:10,840 --> 02:08:13,120
I'll go make some coffee,
and I'll do it with pleasure.

1487
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,480
Why you?

1488
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:18,680
Because you sing beautifully,
but you can't cook.

1489
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:22,200
This is no fish in aspic,
it tastes more like strychnine.

1490
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:27,840
- But you said you liked it.
- I was just toadying.

1491
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:31,000
- You're not too polite.
- That's true.

1492
02:08:31,240 --> 02:08:34,320
I don't know what's gotten into me.
I've become so impudent.

1493
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:38,360
All my life everyone
thought of me as bashful.

1494
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:41,400
Everyone takes advantage of me.
My friends call me "softy".

1495
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:43,720
They just wanted to flatter you.

1496
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:46,760
No. I was of the same
opinion of myself

1497
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,640
You were being overly modest.

1498
02:08:50,520 --> 02:08:52,080
And now I feel...

1499
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:57,240
I'm becoming a different man.

1500
02:08:58,760 --> 02:09:00,840
- More impertinent?
- No, bold.

1501
02:09:01,080 --> 02:09:03,800
- More unmannerly?
- Firm.

1502
02:09:04,040 --> 02:09:05,760
- More impudent?
- Wrong again.

1503
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,440
I feel that...

1504
02:09:12,840 --> 02:09:15,400
I can do anything.

1505
02:09:18,440 --> 02:09:20,280
as if some power inside me

1506
02:09:21,200 --> 02:09:25,360
was asleep, and now it's awakening.

1507
02:09:30,040 --> 02:09:33,200
Maybe it is because I met you?

1508
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:35,920
Thanks to you?

1509
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:40,600
Do you realize what you're saying?

1510
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:42,880
That I made a boor out of you.

1511
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:47,360
It is unheard of!

1512
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:51,200
No one ever called me a boor.

1513
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,000
Nadya, I'm happy.

1514
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:04,320
How can one be so obtrusive!

1515
02:10:06,760 --> 02:10:09,160
I don't know what I'll do to him!

1516
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:12,800
Don't... I'll open it.

1517
02:10:21,800 --> 02:10:25,640
- Nadya, what happened?
- You had a fight?

1518
02:10:26,280 --> 02:10:28,600
Was he rude to you, dear?

1519
02:10:28,840 --> 02:10:30,360
Did he hurt you?

1520
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:33,400
And he produced
such a good impression at first!

1521
02:10:33,640 --> 02:10:36,080
Look at us, the old fools!
We swallowed his act.

1522
02:10:36,320 --> 02:10:38,880
- He's married!
- He has a child?

1523
02:10:39,120 --> 02:10:41,080
I'll explain everything.

1524
02:10:41,680 --> 02:10:44,360
What is this?
Who asked you to barge in here?

1525
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:48,160
Go home, both of you!

1526
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:50,360
Are you crazy?

1527
02:10:50,600 --> 02:10:52,400
She asked us to come.

1528
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:55,920
- Nadya, let's go to my place.
- Give me the coat.

1529
02:10:56,160 --> 02:10:58,880
Give back the coat! It's not yours!

1530
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:01,360
- She's not going anywhere!
- What a tone of voice!

1531
02:11:01,600 --> 02:11:04,480
- A normal tone.
- Why are you bossing around here?

1532
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:07,160
Because I am Ippolit.

1533
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:13,040
- What are you laughing at?
- You liar!

1534
02:11:14,440 --> 02:11:15,840
Girls, don't believe her.

1535
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:18,320
- For the last time...
- Don't believe her.

1536
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,880
- Go ahead, amuse yourself.
- He is not Ippolit.

1537
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:23,360
He is a perfect stranger.

1538
02:11:24,760 --> 02:11:28,720
You don't believe she would
spend a night with a stranger?

1539
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:31,680
- I come home...
- Tell them about the bathhouse.

1540
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:36,520
- And see this...
- In your own bed!

1541
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:41,000
- That's the interesting part.
- I think, we'd better go.

1542
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:44,880
- Zhenya, stop this farce!
- What Zhenya? Where is he?

1543
02:11:45,120 --> 02:11:48,440
You brought Zhenya with you?!
I call a divorce!

1544
02:11:48,720 --> 02:11:50,440
- That's enough!
- Quiet, quiet!

1545
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:54,520
You'll beet him up after we leave.
Go on.

1546
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:55,960
He won't get away with this!

1547
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:58,560
Girls, let's have a drink.

1548
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,880
It's the New Year after all.

1549
02:12:02,920 --> 02:12:05,280
A toast to friendship!

1550
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,400
Yes, let's drink to friendship.

1551
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:11,520
This woman dragged me
along the floor all night.

1552
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,720
Dear Nadya and Ippolit!

1553
02:12:15,960 --> 02:12:17,560
- He is not Ippolit.
- Come on!

1554
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:20,360
Stop it. It's not funny any more!

1555
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:23,240
- Here.
- I won't drink!

1556
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:27,600
I wish you never ever
to fight in the new year.

1557
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:28,960
We won't.

1558
02:12:29,200 --> 02:12:32,280
- Girls, I'm leaving with you.
- I've had enough!

1559
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:34,000
Calm down, Ippolit.

1560
02:12:34,240 --> 02:12:36,800
Why aren't you asking us to kiss?

1561
02:12:37,360 --> 02:12:39,280
Give her a kiss! Give her a kiss!

1562
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:42,480
I don't want to kiss this man!

1563
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:46,560
It's not polite.
Why do you act stubborn?

1564
02:12:47,680 --> 02:12:49,880
The people are waiting!

1565
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:37,840
Where are Tanya and Valya?

1566
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:43,000
You have very good friends.

1567
02:13:45,040 --> 02:13:47,640
- When have you become so familiar?
- Long ago.

1568
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:51,560
Haven't you noticed?

1569
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:01,080
No peace in this house!..

1570
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:04,720
People barging in all the time!

1571
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:08,320
I swear I'll kill whoever it is!

1572
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:16,160
Do the Sinitsyns live here?

1573
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:17,960
What is your surname?

1574
02:14:18,440 --> 02:14:19,640
Sheveleva.

1575
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:23,560
- We're the Shevelevs!
- Wrong address again!

1576
02:14:29,480 --> 02:14:31,600
- What is your surname?
- Lukashin.

1577
02:14:34,680 --> 02:14:36,560
- And the patronymic?
- Mikhailovich.

1578
02:14:37,880 --> 02:14:39,920
Yevgeny Mikhailovich Lukashin.

1579
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:43,880
Nice to meet you.

1580
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,600
- Where are you calling?
- The airport.

1581
02:14:55,880 --> 02:14:58,720
I want to ask when is
the second flight to Moscow.

1582
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:00,960
You decided to postpone your trip?

1583
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,560
I don't want to leave.

1584
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:11,000
Hello! Operator,
when is the second flight to Moscow?

1585
02:15:14,600 --> 02:15:16,000
I see. And the third?

1586
02:15:18,280 --> 02:15:19,520
So soon?

1587
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:21,520
And the fourth?

1588
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:27,960
God dammit!
They leave every half an hour.

1589
02:15:32,640 --> 02:15:35,640
I don't understand,
why I have to leave.

1590
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:37,560
What are you talking about?

1591
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:40,840
I'm coming out
to work only on the 2nd.

1592
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,400
We can walk around the city,

1593
02:15:45,240 --> 02:15:51,200
go to the Hermitage,
and in the evening I'll leave for Moscow.

1594
02:15:51,520 --> 02:15:52,760
By train.

1595
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:56,880
You are being impudent again.

1596
02:15:58,480 --> 02:16:00,400
I didn't invite you to stay.

1597
02:16:02,080 --> 02:16:04,840
What's the problem?
Invite me.

1598
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:11,640
What for?

1599
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:23,280
I have a feeling
there's three of us here.

1600
02:16:23,600 --> 02:16:25,400
Don't touch him!.

1601
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:33,080
I won't do anything to him,
just put him away between books.

1602
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:48,280
All right, let him eavesdrop.
But let him look the other way.

1603
02:16:50,720 --> 02:16:52,400
I prefer not to see him.

1604
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:53,920
Leave him alone!

1605
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:57,760
You stand up for him
as if you cherished the memory of him.

1606
02:16:58,080 --> 02:16:59,320
That's none of your business.

1607
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:02,120
"To my beloved Nadya"?

1608
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:06,560
Well!

1609
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:11,800
That is too much!

1610
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:19,320
- What are you doing?
- Let him go get some fresh air!

1611
02:17:19,560 --> 02:17:21,000
It's good for his health.

1612
02:17:29,640 --> 02:17:32,520
- Go get Ippolit.
- Won't even think of doing it.

1613
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:35,960
- I repeat.
- You don't have to!

1614
02:17:36,640 --> 02:17:39,280
- You'll take the first flight.
- I will do just that!

1615
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:43,720
- Fly away!
- I will! I'll fly away!

1616
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:48,600
Only I'll shave at first.

1617
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:52,320
Shave with this shaver!
And then I'll fly away.

1618
02:17:53,440 --> 02:17:54,840
On an airplane...

1619
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:01,720
This is not a hairdressing parlor.

1620
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:04,440
Don't touch me! I'm unshaved.

1621
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:07,760
I have to look neat
when I meet my fiancee.

1622
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,680
I've forgotten
that you had a fiancee.

1623
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,480
Go open the door!

1624
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:21,120
It must be Ippolit.
It's been a while!

1625
02:18:38,160 --> 02:18:40,680
So now he's shaving
with my electric razor!

1626
02:18:56,920 --> 02:18:59,720
I hope this time he left for good.

1627
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:02,760
Good riddance!

1628
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,920
How come he keeps
his razor at your place?

1629
02:19:11,440 --> 02:19:13,760
You were going to your fiancee?
Well, good luck!

1630
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:18,160
- This shaver belongs to my fiance.
- Your ex-fiance.

1631
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,400
Ippolit is no longer here.
Vanished, gone for good.

1632
02:19:20,640 --> 02:19:23,240
Do you see him? Ippolit!
He's nowhere around!

1633
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:26,920
If he shows up again,
I'll throw him down the stairwell!

1634
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:29,160
Upside down.

1635
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:32,720
What right have you got
to talk like that?

1636
02:19:33,520 --> 02:19:36,280
How come you interfere in my life?

1637
02:19:36,520 --> 02:19:38,560
You have to go to the airport.

1638
02:19:39,160 --> 02:19:43,320
My train is leaving late
in the evening.

1639
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:48,000
Well!.. That's enough!

1640
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:53,840
I'm hungry, and I'm thirsty.

1641
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:56,720
I want to get some rest.

1642
02:19:57,400 --> 02:19:58,880
I'm tired.

1643
02:19:59,800 --> 02:20:03,360
- "A foggy morning"...
- Then I'll leave!

1644
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:06,800
Good riddance!
"A foggy morning"...

1645
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:11,440
"Good riddance"...

1646
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:16,000
- I'll bring a policeman.
- I don't care if it's a squad.

1647
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:20,520
"I don't care if its a firing squad

1648
02:20:25,720 --> 02:20:28,040
"Or a police detachment!"...

1649
02:20:33,320 --> 02:20:34,640
Give me my coat.

1650
02:20:35,560 --> 02:20:38,320
Me? With pleasure!

1651
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:49,160
There you go.

1652
02:20:54,600 --> 02:20:56,160
- Not too tight?
- Zip them.

1653
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:59,680
- What?
- Zip my boots for me.

1654
02:21:02,040 --> 02:21:03,280
With pleasure!

1655
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:07,280
Thank you for the honor.

1656
02:21:11,840 --> 02:21:13,320
What is it?

1657
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,680
Hold on, patient.

1658
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:19,240
Now the other one.

1659
02:21:22,800 --> 02:21:27,880
I dreamed of this all my adult life.

1660
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:40,400
Don't think of cleaning out the
apartment. I know your address.

1661
02:21:41,640 --> 02:21:43,640
Let go of me.

1662
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:02,520
Taxi!

1663
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:20,520
Next time go to a cab stop.

1664
02:23:21,040 --> 02:23:23,000
All right, where to?

1665
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:26,760
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Get out!

1666
02:23:27,080 --> 02:23:29,840
I think I have an idea.

1667
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:33,760
To the Moscow railway station.

1668
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:04,600
You free?

1669
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:30,520
"Let's fill our glasses to the brim!"

1670
02:24:30,760 --> 02:24:32,560
"They lie, who..."

1671
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:42,640
Who are you?

1672
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:46,680
And who are you?

1673
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:49,800
I think I know...

1674
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:53,880
- I'm sorry...
- Don't come any closer, or I'll scream.

1675
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:56,520
I will explain everything.

1676
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:59,120
- Don't move!
- I'm not moving.

1677
02:24:59,360 --> 02:25:02,120
Don't be afraid of me.

1678
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:05,040
What did you break
into our house for?

1679
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:07,320
I'll try to explain.

1680
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:10,400
Me and my friends
have this tradition.

1681
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:14,880
In Moscow every year on
December 31 we go to a bathhouse.

1682
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:18,560
Come on! Turn out your pockets!

1683
02:25:22,360 --> 02:25:24,600
I only stole 15 Rubles.

1684
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:27,520
Not too much.
Put the money on the table.

1685
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:36,440
Where are you?

1686
02:25:37,200 --> 02:25:38,680
Where have you vanished?

1687
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:41,840
I got you!

1688
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:23,880
One ticket to Moscow.

1689
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:28,080
I asked the ash-tree:

1690
02:26:28,320 --> 02:26:32,000
Where is my loved one?

1691
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:36,480
The ash-tree didn't answer me,

1692
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,320
It just shook its head.

1693
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:45,120
I asked the poplar:

1694
02:26:46,080 --> 02:26:49,760
Where is my loved one?

1695
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:54,360
The poplar threw its autumn leaves

1696
02:26:54,920 --> 02:26:58,560
All over me.

1697
02:26:59,640 --> 02:27:03,080
I asked autumn:

1698
02:27:03,960 --> 02:27:07,400
Where is my loved one?

1699
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:11,720
Autumn answered

1700
02:27:13,880 --> 02:27:16,120
With a pouring rain.

1701
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:21,120
I asked the rain:

1702
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:25,240
Where is my loved one?

1703
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:30,440
The rain shed its tears

1704
02:27:31,440 --> 02:27:35,200
Outside my window.

1705
02:27:35,760 --> 02:27:39,240
I asked the half-moon:

1706
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:44,080
Where is my loved one?

1707
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,200
The half-moon hid behind a
cloud

1708
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:52,600
And didn't answer me..

1709
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:57,280
I asked the cloud:

1710
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:01,520
Where is my loved one?

1711
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:06,400
The cloud disappeared

1712
02:28:07,080 --> 02:28:10,240
In the blue of the sky.

1713
02:28:12,320 --> 02:28:15,800
My only true friend,

1714
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:19,720
Where is my loved one?

1715
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:24,440
Tell me where she went.

1716
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:28,080
Do you know where she is?

1717
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:33,600
My only friend,

1718
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:38,000
My only true friend answered me:

1719
02:28:38,560 --> 02:28:42,080
She who was your loved one,

1720
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:46,640
She who was your loved one,

1721
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:51,120
She who was your loved one,

1722
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:55,160
Is now my wife.

1723
02:29:06,120 --> 02:29:09,080
I asked the ash-tree...

1724
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:13,720
I asked autumn...

1725
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:17,840
I asked the poplar...

1726
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:27,080
Mother!
Why are you sitting in the hall?

1727
02:29:27,320 --> 02:29:30,960
I'm guarding a thief,
and he entertains me with his songs.

1728
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:32,520
The thief is me.

1729
02:29:32,760 --> 02:29:34,880
Happy New Year, Nadya.

1730
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:39,840
Mother, let's set him free.

1731
02:29:42,200 --> 02:29:44,920
You're cold?

1732
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:47,960
No, I took a taxi.

1733
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:50,560
Where is it you went by taxi?

1734
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:55,480
I bought you a ticket
on the morning train.

1735
02:29:58,120 --> 02:30:00,120
You bought me a ticket?

1736
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:05,080
Thank you. I'm much obliged.

1737
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,280
The lower berth!

1738
02:30:08,120 --> 02:30:10,600
I don't know how to thank you!

1739
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:15,600
Now I won't have to stand in line.

1740
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:17,040
Thank you.

1741
02:30:18,640 --> 02:30:19,880
Thank you.

1742
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:25,000
Even though
I don't have a very big salary...

1743
02:30:33,240 --> 02:30:36,320
I think I'll go to Lyuba's
to continue to celebrate.

1744
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:40,080
Thank you, you're a terrific mother.

1745
02:30:45,560 --> 02:30:47,920
Nadya, I hope when I return

1746
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:50,200
there won't be another stranger here.

1747
02:30:50,480 --> 02:30:53,080
Don't worry, I'll see to that.

1748
02:31:00,400 --> 02:31:02,520
Remember, I promised you

1749
02:31:02,800 --> 02:31:05,240
I would return
with the photograph of Ippolit?

1750
02:31:11,880 --> 02:31:14,320
- Oh, how terrible!
- You're an adventurer!

1751
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:17,120
- What a pity!
- You're an insolent man!

1752
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:19,480
Jesus, what small pieces!

1753
02:31:20,720 --> 02:31:22,920
- You're a shameless boor!
- Of course.

1754
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:24,680
- A gangster!
- Of course.

1755
02:31:24,920 --> 02:31:26,280
- A barbarian!
- Of course.

1756
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:30,480
- An alcoholic.
- Of course.

1757
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:34,280
- A lump.
- Yes, yes.

1758
02:31:34,720 --> 02:31:36,440
You know who you are?..

1759
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,080
Let's not open it.

1760
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:54,360
We're not in.

1761
02:31:59,480 --> 02:32:02,960
Whoever it is,
let's not open the door.

1762
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:06,880
Strange people.

1763
02:32:08,240 --> 02:32:10,800
If we don't open,
that means we're not in.

1764
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,160
And if we're in but we don't open it,

1765
02:32:15,880 --> 02:32:18,640
that means we don't want
to see anyone.

1766
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:25,800
How tactless!

1767
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:29,040
How unmannered!

1768
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:36,280
That's too much!

1769
02:32:36,600 --> 02:32:38,560
We won't open to spite them.

1770
02:32:46,200 --> 02:32:47,680
Hold on, Nadya.

1771
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,120
Have they lost their mind?

1772
02:32:54,160 --> 02:32:55,640
Be brave.

1773
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,760
We will have to open.

1774
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:06,640
Or they'll break down the door.

1775
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:08,840
All right, then I'll open it.

1776
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:11,880
Zhenya!

1777
02:33:12,200 --> 02:33:13,680
Control yourself!

1778
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:23,080
Guys! It's me breaking down
your door.

1779
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:26,120
I've come...

1780
02:33:28,200 --> 02:33:32,080
to wish you a Happy New Year.

1781
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:34,760
Please accept... Well, you know.

1782
02:33:35,480 --> 02:33:38,640
I'm hungry as hell!

1783
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:41,440
That's the first time
I see you in such a state!

1784
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:45,360
It is the first time
I am in such a state.

1785
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:48,760
That's the first time
I see myself in such a state.

1786
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:53,280
"Outside a young fellow
got chilled to the marrow".

1787
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:58,640
Thin soles. He knows.

1788
02:33:58,880 --> 02:34:00,360
He knows everything.

1789
02:34:01,360 --> 02:34:03,960
But I met these kind people!

1790
02:34:04,600 --> 02:34:08,960
They gave me shelter,
they mugged me and confronted me...

1791
02:34:10,240 --> 02:34:13,080
I mean, they hugged me
and comforted me...

1792
02:34:14,760 --> 02:34:17,480
Life is an amazing thing.

1793
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:20,560
It's so full of surprises.

1794
02:34:21,920 --> 02:34:23,280
Excuse me...

1795
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:30,760
And that is absolutely wonderful!

1796
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:33,800
Can there be a programmed,

1797
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:36,840
projected and planned happiness?

1798
02:34:41,320 --> 02:34:44,160
My god! We live such boring lives!

1799
02:34:45,320 --> 02:34:47,840
We lost the spirit of adventurism!

1800
02:34:48,400 --> 02:34:51,640
We no longer climb through
windows to see our loved ones,

1801
02:34:51,880 --> 02:34:55,640
we are afraid
of doing sweet stupid things.

1802
02:34:56,520 --> 02:35:02,520
It's awful!
Your fish in aspic tastes positively awful!

1803
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:11,640
Next year on New Year's eve
I will go to a bathhouse.

1804
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:16,280
Why wait a whole year?

1805
02:35:18,560 --> 02:35:20,760
That's right. Good idea!

1806
02:35:22,320 --> 02:35:23,800
How true!

1807
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:28,720
Let me through.

1808
02:35:30,600 --> 02:35:32,080
Thank you.

1809
02:35:49,840 --> 02:35:51,880
I think he opened the taps.

1810
02:35:52,360 --> 02:35:53,600
What for?

1811
02:35:58,840 --> 02:36:01,920
Are you out of your mind?!
Stop it!

1812
02:36:02,160 --> 02:36:03,880
Won't even think of it!

1813
02:36:04,360 --> 02:36:06,560
Do you understand what you're doing?

1814
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:07,960
Don't touch me!

1815
02:36:08,200 --> 02:36:11,160
Ippolit, you'll ruin your coat.

1816
02:36:11,480 --> 02:36:13,920
Nadya, don't niggle!

1817
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:17,160
I beg you to get out of there!

1818
02:36:17,920 --> 02:36:19,440
Would you at least take off your hat.

1819
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:23,400
I feel comfortable as it is.
And you shut up!

1820
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:28,600
There's warm water!

1821
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:33,320
On New Year's Eve
a man goes to a bathhouse.

1822
02:36:33,680 --> 02:36:36,080
This characterizes
him very positively.

1823
02:36:36,360 --> 02:36:39,440
There he gets drunk,
celebrating his engagement.

1824
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,680
Another positive characteristic.

1825
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:44,680
Then he is loaded
on an airplane like a wooden log,

1826
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:50,640
and he gets to another city.

1827
02:36:51,720 --> 02:36:54,520
Would you scrub my back, please.

1828
02:36:55,400 --> 02:36:57,800
Is it that difficult?

1829
02:36:59,160 --> 02:37:01,920
Well, as you wish.

1830
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:05,840
What can I do?

1831
02:37:08,320 --> 02:37:14,320
In that city he meets another woman.

1832
02:37:16,720 --> 02:37:20,440
He forgets about
his Moscow fiancee, naturally,

1833
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:27,000
and settles for this new one
in Leningrad.

1834
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:36,080
All because he is a man
of high moral standards.

1835
02:37:36,560 --> 02:37:38,040
Please, stop it.

1836
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:40,200
You take that as an offense?

1837
02:37:40,440 --> 02:37:42,520
Don't be offended. It is the truth.

1838
02:37:42,760 --> 02:37:46,840
One can't be offended at the truth,
even if it's the bitter truth.

1839
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:53,480
Nadya, in such a short time one
can destroy the past,

1840
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:56,960
but one can't build a future.

1841
02:37:57,920 --> 02:37:58,920
It is impossible.

1842
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:04,680
The New Year's night
is coming to an end. It will be sobering up

1843
02:38:05,920 --> 02:38:07,240
and emptiness.

1844
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:13,080
The most important thing
is that you both know I'm right.

1845
02:38:28,160 --> 02:38:29,480
I'm sorry.

1846
02:38:32,760 --> 02:38:35,280
Where are you going?
You'll catch cold!

1847
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:36,680
Leave me alone.

1848
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:39,480
Please don't go! Stay!

1849
02:38:40,720 --> 02:38:42,160
It's freezing cold outside!

1850
02:38:42,400 --> 02:38:44,560
Maybe I want to...

1851
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:49,360
catch cold and die.

1852
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:00,440
My god, I am tired!

1853
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:08,280
What a mad night.

1854
02:39:12,240 --> 02:39:14,440
If he comes back...

1855
02:39:17,840 --> 02:39:19,440
he will set the house on fire.

1856
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:24,120
To be honest...

1857
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:28,240
I really like him.

1858
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:33,960
He just said
what we didn't dare to say to each other.

1859
02:39:38,720 --> 02:39:40,200
You're crazy.

1860
02:39:42,840 --> 02:39:44,160
Come to your senses.

1861
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:46,960
That's exactly
what is happening to me now.

1862
02:39:50,240 --> 02:39:54,320
They're going to bed at Luyba's
and it's cold at the landing.

1863
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:58,440
Did you pour water over Ippolit?

1864
02:39:59,160 --> 02:40:01,080
He was soaking wet.

1865
02:40:01,320 --> 02:40:03,680
He's wet with tears.

1866
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:10,560
You hurt such a good man!

1867
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:20,440
Well...

1868
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:26,040
You have to go.

1869
02:40:44,560 --> 02:40:48,760
But planes leave every half an hour.

1870
02:40:55,160 --> 02:40:57,280
Half an hour won't save anything.

1871
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,800
It is absurd. It is foolish.

1872
02:41:14,320 --> 02:41:17,480
We won't forgive ourselves
afterwards.

1873
02:41:19,920 --> 02:41:22,040
One needs to learn
to restrain one's feelings.

1874
02:41:22,280 --> 02:41:23,400
What for?

1875
02:41:24,680 --> 02:41:27,160
Don't you think we restrain
ourselves too often?

1876
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:31,400
You must agree, Ippolit is right.

1877
02:41:36,560 --> 02:41:38,920
We have slightly gone mad.

1878
02:41:45,320 --> 02:41:47,360
The New Year's night is over.

1879
02:41:50,520 --> 02:41:52,880
Everything sets back in its place.

1880
02:42:08,600 --> 02:42:11,120
I want to ask the mirror

1881
02:42:11,360 --> 02:42:16,480
With the cloudy misty dreams,

1882
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:19,960
I want to make it tell me,

1883
02:42:20,200 --> 02:42:26,200
Where you are heading and
Where will you find shelter.

1884
02:42:27,800 --> 02:42:30,320
I see

1885
02:42:32,280 --> 02:42:34,680
The mast of a tall ship,

1886
02:42:35,800 --> 02:42:38,760
And you standing on the deck.

1887
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:45,160
And in the steam of the train
I see fields,

1888
02:42:47,040 --> 02:42:49,440
Wrapped in the dusky sadness,

1889
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:55,240
The evening fields in dew,

1890
02:42:57,800 --> 02:43:01,240
Ravens circling over them,

1891
02:43:02,440 --> 02:43:05,320
I bless you,

1892
02:43:06,240 --> 02:43:08,640
I bless you,

1893
02:43:09,680 --> 02:43:12,080
I bless you

1894
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:17,400
To go wherever you want.

1895
02:43:18,520 --> 02:43:21,560
I bless you,

1896
02:43:22,120 --> 02:43:25,240
I bless you,

1897
02:43:27,960 --> 02:43:30,720
I bless you

1898
02:43:30,960 --> 02:43:36,960
To go wherever you want.

1899
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:51,080
It's morning already.

1900
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:55,800
I have a feeling,

1901
02:43:56,040 --> 02:43:59,360
that in one night
we lived a whole life.

1902
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:04,360
Get the ticket.

1903
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:07,200
I think you can still find it.

1904
02:44:08,800 --> 02:44:12,560
No, I won't go by train.

1905
02:44:18,120 --> 02:44:19,920
To jolt about for 7 hours.

1906
02:44:32,560 --> 02:44:34,040
Please...

1907
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:38,600
Remember me.

1908
02:44:40,280 --> 02:44:41,840
You too.

1909
02:44:45,800 --> 02:44:47,280
Go, Zhenya, go.

1910
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:52,640
May I kiss you good-bye?

1911
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:56,400
No, please don't.

1912
02:44:58,120 --> 02:45:00,960
Please don't, have mercy
on me.

1913
02:45:10,440 --> 02:45:12,880
Let's sit for the road.

1914
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:28,000
I stole your photograph.

1915
02:45:30,800 --> 02:45:34,760
I'm pleased
that you will have my photo.

1916
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:46,760
And if planes won't leave
due to bad weather, can I stay?

1917
02:45:47,280 --> 02:45:50,840
No, then take the train.

1918
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:29,680
Oh, darling, how painful
and how strange it is,

1919
02:48:30,120 --> 02:48:32,640
After intertwining our roots
And branches,

1920
02:48:33,360 --> 02:48:35,480
How painful and how strange It is

1921
02:48:35,720 --> 02:48:37,720
To be sawed in two.

1922
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:40,800
The heart wound will never mend,

1923
02:48:41,040 --> 02:48:43,080
The pain will pour out
in pure tear drops,

1924
02:48:43,560 --> 02:48:45,680
The heart wound will never mend,

1925
02:48:46,040 --> 02:48:48,400
The pain will pour out
in fiery pitch.

1926
02:48:48,680 --> 02:48:50,640
I'll be with you for as long as live,

1927
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:53,040
Soul and blood are inseparable.

1928
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:55,040
I'll be with you for as long as live.

1929
02:48:55,640 --> 02:48:57,920
Love and death always
go hand in hand.

1930
02:48:58,200 --> 02:49:00,240
My beloved,
you will carry wih you,

1931
02:49:00,520 --> 02:49:02,320
You will carry with you
everywhere you go,

1932
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,240
You will carry with you
everywhere you go

1933
02:49:05,520 --> 02:49:08,200
Your native land
and your home place.

1934
02:49:08,440 --> 02:49:12,040
What if I'll have nothing to
cover myself from incurable pity

1935
02:49:12,280 --> 02:49:15,960
And from the cold and darkness
of the night?

1936
02:49:16,240 --> 02:49:20,360
There will be reunions after parting.
Remember me, beloved.

1937
02:49:20,600 --> 02:49:22,720
There will be reunions after parting,

1938
02:49:22,960 --> 02:49:25,680
We will return, you and me.

1939
02:49:25,920 --> 02:49:29,880
What if I vanish into eternity,
A flash of daylight in the dark?

1940
02:49:30,280 --> 02:49:31,840
What if I sink into oblivion,

1941
02:49:32,080 --> 02:49:35,280
Disappear behind the stars
and dust clouds?

1942
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:39,400
I will pray that you would
find the way back to Earth.

1943
02:49:39,720 --> 02:49:44,160
I will pray that you would
come home safe and sound

1944
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:46,200
Jolting in the carriage
filled with cigarette smoke,

1945
02:49:46,480 --> 02:49:49,280
He felt homeless and humble,

1946
02:49:49,640 --> 02:49:54,200
Jolting in the carriage,
he was half-crying, half-sleping,

1947
02:49:54,800 --> 02:49:57,000
When on a slippery slope

1948
02:49:57,280 --> 02:50:00,160
The train curved
with a horrible list,

1949
02:50:00,800 --> 02:50:03,240
When on a slippery slope

1950
02:50:03,520 --> 02:50:06,000
The train tore its wheels
away from the rails,

1951
02:50:06,560 --> 02:50:08,520
And a superhuman force,

1952
02:50:08,920 --> 02:50:11,400
Crushing everyone
and everything in one squeeze,

1953
02:50:11,720 --> 02:50:13,760
A superhuman force

1954
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:16,400
Shook everything living off
the face of the Earth,

1955
02:50:17,760 --> 02:50:22,560
And no one was saved by the
promised reunion,

1956
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:28,400
And no one was protected by the hand,
stretched out far away.

1957
02:50:28,800 --> 02:50:31,400
Don't part with your loved ones,

1958
02:50:31,920 --> 02:50:34,520
Don't part with your loved ones,

1959
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:36,960
Don't part with your loved ones,

1960
02:50:37,560 --> 02:50:40,320
Sprout in them with your blood.

1961
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:43,240
And every time say good-bye forever,

1962
02:50:43,480 --> 02:50:46,040
Every time say good-bye forever,

1963
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:49,240
Every time say good-bye forever,

1964
02:50:49,520 --> 02:50:52,040
When you're parting for an instant.

1965
02:50:57,760 --> 02:50:59,760
Would you care to explain
what happened?

1966
02:51:00,560 --> 02:51:03,720
I didn't know what to think!
I was so worried!

1967
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,480
Where were you?

1968
02:51:07,080 --> 02:51:09,640
Tell me what happened.
Where is Galya?

1969
02:51:10,320 --> 02:51:13,640
I went to Leningrad.

1970
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,240
Where?

1971
02:51:16,280 --> 02:51:17,600
Leinigrad.

1972
02:51:19,120 --> 02:51:22,360
I'm sorry,
but I'm terribly tired and I want to sleep.

1973
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:27,880
You ran away to Leningrad again?

1974
02:51:29,160 --> 02:51:31,520
Mother, you know that

1975
02:51:33,760 --> 02:51:39,680
every year on December 31
my friends and I go to a bathhouse.

1976
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:43,080
We take a bath.

1977
02:51:44,480 --> 02:51:46,680
There we had a drink.

1978
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:51,840
And strictly by accident,
without any ill intent

1979
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:57,520
I was sent to Leningrad
instead of Pavel.

1980
02:51:59,600 --> 02:52:01,160
What do you mean, sent?

1981
02:52:03,280 --> 02:52:06,720
What are you -
a package or a suitcase?

1982
02:52:06,960 --> 02:52:10,040
Mother, please. My head is splitting.

1983
02:52:13,440 --> 02:52:15,720
Didn't you realize what was going on?

1984
02:52:16,920 --> 02:52:18,360
Not a thing.

1985
02:52:20,240 --> 02:52:23,560
You've become so undisciplined!
What a disgrace!

1986
02:52:24,760 --> 02:52:30,000
You have to get married.
There will be someone to organize you.

1987
02:52:31,480 --> 02:52:35,000
It won't be easy
to make peace with Galya.

1988
02:52:35,240 --> 02:52:38,840
But I'll go to her place
and bring her here.

1989
02:52:39,080 --> 02:52:41,080
Please don't do that!

1990
02:52:44,960 --> 02:52:47,280
You no longer want to marry Galya?

1991
02:52:49,480 --> 02:52:51,560
I met another woman.

1992
02:52:52,840 --> 02:52:55,360
- Where?
- In Leningrad.

1993
02:52:57,160 --> 02:53:00,480
- When?
- Tonight.

1994
02:53:02,240 --> 02:53:03,480
Oh, my God!

1995
02:53:04,320 --> 02:53:06,760
And this is why
you want to part with Galya?

1996
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:08,200
Yes.

1997
02:53:12,120 --> 02:53:14,120
Mother, what is it?

1998
02:53:15,480 --> 02:53:17,800
- Mother, what's with you?
- Wait.

1999
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:21,920
You feel better now?

2000
02:53:25,680 --> 02:53:28,320
You are a womanizer.
A hopeless womanizer.

2001
02:53:34,400 --> 02:53:37,040
No, mother, I'm a miserable man.

2002
02:53:38,640 --> 02:53:40,840
Why am I so unlucky?

2003
02:53:45,520 --> 02:53:47,520
To think of it,
I don't have to marry at all.

2004
02:53:47,760 --> 02:53:49,680
What for?

2005
02:53:51,040 --> 02:53:52,280
I don't have to.

2006
02:53:54,080 --> 02:53:57,320
No one will take care of me
better than you do.

2007
02:53:57,560 --> 02:53:58,960
You sly-boots!

2008
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:11,240
Just imagine, a strange woman
walking around the apartment.

2009
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,320
Who knows if you'll even
like one another.

2010
02:54:20,280 --> 02:54:21,760
What if you don't?

2011
02:54:23,480 --> 02:54:25,480
I will become irritated.

2012
02:54:26,440 --> 02:54:27,760
No, that's it.

2013
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,760
The hell with it!

2014
02:54:31,640 --> 02:54:34,120
Let everything stay the way it was.

2015
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:36,960
My poor child!

2016
02:54:38,120 --> 02:54:39,360
Lie down.

2017
02:54:39,600 --> 02:54:42,080
Lie down,
everything's going to be fine.

2018
02:54:43,320 --> 02:54:44,840
Lie down, get some sleep.

2019
02:54:59,040 --> 02:55:00,040
What's her name?

2020
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:04,920
She has the most beautiful name.

2021
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:10,520
Nadya.

2022
02:55:13,040 --> 02:55:14,520
And what's important,
an uncommon one.

2023
02:58:22,840 --> 02:58:24,120
Nadya.

2024
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:37,160
You left your birch switch.

2025
02:58:38,600 --> 02:58:39,920
How did you find me?

2026
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:43,160
You are a hopeless dimwit.

2027
02:59:12,040 --> 02:59:16,240
My god, not again!

2028
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:18,720
I hope it is not Ippolit.

2029
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:24,560
Hello!
Happy New Year!

2030
02:59:25,320 --> 02:59:26,800
Happy New Year!

2031
02:59:29,400 --> 02:59:30,520
Wish you all the best!

2032
02:59:30,760 --> 02:59:31,880
Where is he?

2033
02:59:32,120 --> 02:59:33,680
Wake him up.

2034
02:59:39,960 --> 02:59:41,320
Hello.

2035
02:59:42,520 --> 02:59:45,920
How could I have made such a
blunder? I never ever get drunk.

2036
02:59:47,840 --> 02:59:51,800
I'm happy to see,
that you, Zhenya, and...

2037
02:59:53,280 --> 02:59:54,360
Galya.

2038
02:59:54,600 --> 02:59:58,360
That we are your friends
and Galya has forgiven you.

2039
02:59:58,600 --> 03:00:00,680
Zhenya, quit kissing around.

2040
03:00:01,440 --> 03:00:05,640
We can't. We've missed
each other so much.

2041
03:00:06,200 --> 03:00:09,440
I don't care if they kiss. Do you?
Do you feel uneasy? Not me.

2042
03:00:09,680 --> 03:00:12,600
Zhenya, we are happy
that Galya has forgiven you.

2043
03:00:12,840 --> 03:00:16,720
We are happy,
that you and Galya have reunited.

2044
03:00:19,880 --> 03:00:21,120
Mother!

2045
03:00:23,560 --> 03:00:25,640
My Nadya has come.

2046
03:00:37,040 --> 03:00:40,680
You think I am light-headed?

2047
03:00:42,040 --> 03:00:43,520
We shall wait and see.

2048
03:00:46,440 --> 03:00:50,440
- Do you understand what's going on?
- Are you asking me?

2049
03:00:51,440 --> 03:00:54,520
I have a feeling this is not Galya.

2050
03:00:57,120 --> 03:01:01,120
Well say something.
You're the most quick-witted of all.

2051
03:01:01,800 --> 03:01:05,640
I can say for sure
that one of them is Zhenya.

2052
03:01:07,120 --> 03:01:08,520
Friends!

2053
03:01:10,720 --> 03:01:14,760
I am grateful to you
for changing my life.

2054
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:18,600
I am grateful that fate
lead me to Leningrad.

2055
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,960
And that in Leningrad
there is a street of the same name, a house

2056
03:01:25,840 --> 03:01:27,400
just like mine
and an apartment just like mine.

2057
03:01:30,200 --> 03:01:32,600
Otherwise I would never be happy.

2058
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:35,120
We would never be happy.

2059
03:01:36,280 --> 03:01:38,920
We would never be happy.

2060
03:01:44,080 --> 03:01:47,120
I asked the ash-tree:

2061
03:01:48,200 --> 03:01:50,560
Where is my loved one?

2062
03:01:50,800 --> 03:01:53,160
Cast:

2063
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,960
Andrei MYAGKOV

2064
03:01:57,200 --> 03:01:59,960
Barbara BRYLSKA

2065
03:02:00,200 --> 03:02:02,760
Yuri YAKOVLEV

2066
